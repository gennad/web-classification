Two lawyers are in a bank, when, suddenly, armed robbers burst in.  While
several of the robbers take the money from the tellers, others line the
customers, including the lawyers, up against a wall, and proceed to take their
wallets, watches, etc.  While this is going on lawyer number one jams something
in lawyer number two's hand.  Without looking down, lawyer number two whispers,
"What is this?", to which lawyer number one replies, "it's that $50 I owe you."
