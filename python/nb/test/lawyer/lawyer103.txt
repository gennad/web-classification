                       A truck driver used to amuse himself by running over
                       lawyers he saw on the side of the street.Everytime he would
                       hit a lawyer he would hear a thump.One day he saw a priest
                       on the side of the road so he pulled over and asked the preist
                       where he was going "To the church 5 miles down the road"
                       he replied so the truck driver asked if he would like a ride.the
                       priest got in the truck.about a mile down the road the truck
                       driver saw a lawyer he swerved to hit him but then
                       remember the preist was with him,yet he still heard the
                       thump noise.he woundered why. "I'm sorry I almost hit that
                       lawyer" the truck driver said. "Thats ok I got him with the
                       door" the priest answed back.
