These two guys, George and Harry, set out in a hot air balloon to cross the
Atlantic Ocean.  After 37 hours in the air, George says "Harry, we better lose
some altitude so we can see where we are".  Harry lets out some of the hot air
in the balloon, and the balloon descends to below the cloud cover.  George says,
"I still can't tell where we are, lets ask that guy on the ground".  So Harry
yells down to the man "Hey, could you tell us where we are?".  And the man on
the ground yells back "You're in a balloon, 100 feet up in the air".  George
turns to Harry and says "That man must be a lawyer".  And Harry says "How can
you tell?".  George says "Because the advice he gave us is 100% accurate, and
totally useless".  That's the end of the Joke, but for you people who are still
worried about George and Harry: They end up in the drink, and make the front
page of the New York Times: "Balloonists Soaked by Lawyer".
