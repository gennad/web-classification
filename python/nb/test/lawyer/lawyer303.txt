   About 1900, a very respectable Western lawyer was filing some insurance
papers when he came to the question: "If your father is dead, state the cause."
Unwilling to reveal that his father had been hanged for cattle rustling, the
lawyer evaded the problem by answering this way: "He died while taking part in a
public ceremony when the platform gave way."
   After successfully passing the bar exam, a man opened his own law office.  He
was sitting idle at his desk when his secretary announced that a Mr. Jones had
arrived to see him.
   "Show him right in!" our lawyer replied.
   As Mr. Jones was being ushered in, our lawyer had an idea.  He quickly picks
up the phone and shouts into it "And you tell them that we won't accept less
then fifty thousand dollars, and don't even call me until you agree to that
amount!"
   Slamming the phone down he stood up and greeted Mr. Jones; "Good Morning, Mr.
Jones, what can I do for you?"
   "I'm from the phone company" Mr. Jones replied, "I'm here to connect your
phone."
