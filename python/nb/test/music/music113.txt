Last summer, the local orchestra decided to play Beethoven's 9th symphony.
However, it being quite hot, the players were working up quite a sweat, until a
neighbor let them use the ventilators in her house.  However, the wind from
these ventilators was causing the notes to blow all over the place, so they had
to tie them down to the note holders.  The din from the ventilators was so bad
that the bassists decided it didn't matter if they downed a few drinks and got
royally drunk.  Two of the bassists get so drunk, they pass out.  One of the
violinists, in disgust, decided to go home but slipped and fell.  Thus, it was
the bottom of the 9th, the bassists were loaded, the score was tied with two men
out and the fans were roaring wild when one of the players slid home.
