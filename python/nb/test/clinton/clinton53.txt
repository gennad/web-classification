It seems a man went into a bar, and saw Komrade Klinton on the tv and made a 
rather disgusting remark about the president's being a real horse's @@@. 
Almost immediately he was soundly decked by one of the other customers.  Upon 
getting the cobwebs out of his brain, he remarked, "Gee, this must be real 
Clinton country around here." "No," came the reply, "this is horse country." 
  
What is 15 inches long and hangs down directly in front of a  horse's a**? 
Bill Clinton's necktie
