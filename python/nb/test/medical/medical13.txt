   Doctor:  I have some good news and I have some bad news, which shall I tell
first?
   Patient: Do begin with the bad news, please.
   Doctor:  All Right.  Your son has drowned, your daughter has been raped, your
wife has divorced you, your house got blown away, and you have AIDS.
   Patient: Good grief!  What's the good news?
   Doctor:  The good news is that there is no more bad news.
