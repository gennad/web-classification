   This man is waiting for his wife to deliver his first child.  When the doctor
comes out of the operating room, he comes up to him and asks to see his wife and
baby.
   Doctor: I have something to tell you...  Your baby has got no legs...
   Father: Oh...  I guess it's still my son.  Let me see it.
   Doctor: He's got no arms either...
   Father: That bad, uh?  I have to see it!
   Doctor: And he's got no trunk either...  No head...  Actually, it's only an
ear...
   Father: ...
   Then they go in a sterile room where a nurse carries in a cradle with a huge
ear in it.
   Father: My son!!!  Flesh of my flesh!!!  Blood of my blood!!!
   Doctor: LOUDER!!!  He's deaf too...
