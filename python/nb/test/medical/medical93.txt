A 90-year old man announces his intention to marry a woman of 30.  He is
persuaded to have a medical exam first.  "Everyone tells me I need a checkup to
see if I'm sexually fit", he says to the doctor.  "O. K.", says the medic, "let
me see your sex organs."  So the old guy sticks out his tongue and his middle
finger.
