A businessman was in Japan to make a presentation to the Toyota motor people.
Needless to say, this was an especially important deal, and it was imperative
that he make the best possible impression.  On the morning of the presentation
he awoke to find himself passing gas, in large volumes, with the unpleasant
characteristic of sounding like "HONDA."  The man was besides himself.  Every
few minutes "HONDA", "HONDA"....  Unable to stop this aberrant behavior, and in
desperate need to terminate these odious and rather embarrassing emissions, he
sought a physicians aid.  After a full examination, the doctor told him that
there was nothing inherently wrong with him and that he would just have to wait
it out.  Being unwilling to accept this state of affairs he visited a second
and then a third doctor all of whom told him the same thing.  Finally one medic
suggested that he visit a dentist.  Well although he could not see how a
dentist was going to be of any help, he visited one anyway.  Lo and behold, the
dentist said, "Ah, there's the problem"  "What is it?" the man asked.  "Why you
have an abscess," said the dentist.  "An abscess.  How could that be causing my
problem?" asked the man.  "That's easy," replied the dentist.  "Why everyone
knows...  Abscess makes the fart go Honda."
