A man went to a doctor to have his penis enlarged.  Well, this particular
procedure involved splicing a baby elephant's trunk onto the man's penis.
Overjoyed, the man went out with his best girl to a very fancy restaurant.
After cocktails, the man's penis crept out of his pants, felt around the table,
grabbed a hard roll and quickly disappeared under the tablecloth.  The girl was
startled and exclaimed, "What was that?".  Suddenly the penis came back, took
another hard roll and just as quickly disappeared.  The girl was silent for a
moment, then finally said, "I don't believe I saw what I think I just saw...
Can you do that again?"  With a bit of an uncomfortable smile the man replied,
"Honey, I'd like to, but I don't think my ass can take another hard roll!"
