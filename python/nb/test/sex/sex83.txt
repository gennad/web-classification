   Bill worked in a pickle factory.  He had been employed there for a number of
years when he came home one day to confess to his wife that he had a terrible
compulsion.  He had an urge to stick his penis into the pickle slicer.  His wife
suggested that he should see a sex therapist to talk about it, but Bill
indicated that he'd be too embarrassed.  He vowed to overcome the compulsion on
his own.
   One day a few weeks later, Bill came home absolutely ashen.  His wife could
see at once that something was seriously wrong.
   "What's wrong, Bill?" she asked.
   "Do you remember that I told you how I had this tremendous urge to put my
penis into the pickle slicer?"
   "Oh, Bill, you didn't."
   "Yes, I did."
   "My God, Bill, what happened?"
   "I got fired."
   "No, Bill.  I mean, what happened with the pickle slicer?"
   "Oh...she got fired too."
