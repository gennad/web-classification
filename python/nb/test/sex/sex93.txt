   A Martian expedition came to Earth to observe humans.
   The alien spacecraft landed in the middle of the Arizona desert, infront of
an old, abandoned gas station.  One of the aliens decides to interact with one
of the old gas pumps (confusing it with a human, since it had a round head).
   The alien steps forth and asks, "What is your name?  Who is your leader?
What do you do here?"  The gas pump didn't respond.
   The alien gets in his spacecraft and contacts the mother ship to give his
report.  The alien says, " I have observed the humans.  They are deaf, dumb, and
as a side note, never send a female Martian to explore this planet because they
have dicks so long, they hang them from their ear."
