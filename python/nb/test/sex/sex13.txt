   A teenager of about 17 has a hot date with a girl, so he decided to go to the
pharmacy to buy some condoms.

(Conversation as follows)

   Pharm:  What can I help you with?
   Teen:  I'd like to...uh... ah... buy a condom.
   Pharm:  Ok.  Here you are.  (Sets condom, on counter.)
   Teen:  (Thinking that was rather easy and painless) Well, now that I think
about it, I think I'll be needing two condoms.
   Pharm:  Well, ok.  (Gets another one).
   Teen:  (Getting bolder.)  Actually, its a pretty hot date I have tonight, I
think I'll be needing four condoms.
   (Teen keeps changing his mind and increasing the number of condoms he wants
until he's leaving the pharmacy with 2 dozen condoms)
   Now the teenager arrives at his girlfriend's house.  She tells him that he's
invited to stay for dinner.  So he goes in and sits down at the table with all
of her family.  The father asks if he'd like to say grace before beginning the
meal.  He accepts and says the following:
   Teen:  Oh Lord, thank you for this food and the hands that made it, and the
people who took the time to grow it and...  (goes on for nearly 10 minutes,
blessing EVERYTHING including the table, the silverware, all the containers, the
floor, etc...) ...AMEN.
   Girl:  Gee, I didn't know that you were really religious.
   Teen:  Well, I didn't know that your dad was a pharmacist.
