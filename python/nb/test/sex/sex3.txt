   "Oh, I get to choose?  What do you have?"
   "Well we have a six-pack, a nine-pack and a twelve-pack."
   "Why so many different ones?"
   "Well the six-pack is very popular with our customers of the Jewish

   "Why is that?"
   "Evidently, once a night, except the sabbath."

   "That is very popular with our customers of the black persuasion.  Once a
night and twice on weekends."
   "How about the twelve-pack."
   "That is very popular with our customers of the white persuasion...January,
February, March..."
