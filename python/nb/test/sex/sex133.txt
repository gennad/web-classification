Private Weston was stationed in Arabia during Desert Storm in a fairly isolated
location in the desert.  After a couple of weeks without seeing a single woman,
he inquired to his sergeant about some leave to get some action.  "Well, hell
boy, just use the camel, like everyone else.", the sergeant replied.  Private
Weston looked at the smelly animal, drooling all over the place.  "What do you
think I am, some sicko pervert?" he says.  The sergeant just shrugs, "Suit
yourself."  A couple of weeks pass by.  And the pressure is just a-building in
the loins of private Weston. He again approaches his sergeant.  "Serg, you just
gotta give me some leave or I'm gonna bust."  The sergeant says, "Look boy I
told ya, if you want some action, go use the camel.  Weston goes over to the
camel.  He walks behind it and sees all the fleas and dirt surrounding the
camel's butt.  "Nope, still not that desperate", he says to himself and walks
away.  More weeks go by and Private Weston once again approaches his sergeant.
Before he can speak, the sergeant yells, "Look Weston, I'm not telling you
again.  Either use the camel or forget it!"  Chastised, Private Weston goes to
the camel.  "Well at least its a large, furry, female mammal", he thinks.  He
walks behind the camel and goes at it.  After he's done, the sergeant walks up
to him, visibly shaken and says, "Look, man, the others use the camel to ride
into town and pick up girls."  He was promoted to Colonel a week later.
