First of all let me make it clear that I have nothing against
contravariant functors.  Some of my best friends are cohomology
theories!  But now you aren't supposed to call them contravariant
anymore.  It's Algebraically Correct to call them 'differently
arrowed'!!

In the same way that transcendental numbers are polynomially
challenged?

Manifolds are personifolds (humanifolds).

Neighborhoods are neighbor victims of society.

It's the Asian Remainder Theorem.

It isn't PC to use "singularity" - the function is "convergently
challenged" there.
