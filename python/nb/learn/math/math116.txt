The guy gets on a bus and starts threatening everybody: "I'll integrate
you!  I'll differentiate you!!!"  So everybody gets scared and runs
away.  Only one person stays.  The guy comes up to him and says:
"Aren't you scared, I'll integrate you, I'll differentiate you!!!"  And
the other guy says; "No, I am not scared, I am e to the x."
