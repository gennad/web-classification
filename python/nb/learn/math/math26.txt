A mathematician and a physicist were asked the following question:

        Suppose you walked by a burning house and saw a hydrant and
        a hose not connected to the hydrant.  What would you do?

P: I would attach the hose to the hydrant, turn on the water, and put out
   the fire.

M: I would attach the hose to the hydrant, turn on the water, and put out
   the fire.

Then they were asked this question:

        Suppose you walked by a house and saw a hose connected to
        a hydrant.  What would you do?

P: I would keep walking, as there is no problem to solve.

M: I would disconnect the hose from the hydrant and set the house on fire,
   reducing the problem to a previously solved form.
