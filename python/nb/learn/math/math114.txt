There was once a very smart horse.  Anything that was shown it, it
mastered easily, until one day, its teachers tried to teach it about
rectangular coordinates and it couldn't understand them.  All the
horse's acquaintances and friends tried to figure out what was the
matter and couldn't.  Then a new guy (what the heck, a computer
engineer) looked at the problem and said,

"Of course he can't do it.  Why, you're putting Descartes before the
horse!"
