Another "true" story, kinda like the aforementioned urban legend:

Enrico Fermi, while studying in college, was bored by his math
classes.  He walked up to the professor and said, "My classes are too
easy!"  The professor looked at him, and said, "Well, I'm sure you'll
find this interesting."  Then the professor copied 9 problems from a
book to a paper and gave the paper to Fermi.  A month later, the
professor ran into Fermi, "So how are you doing with the problems I
gave you?"  "Oh, they are very hard.  I only managed to solve 6 of
them."  The professor was visibly shocked, "What!? But those are
unsolved problems!"
