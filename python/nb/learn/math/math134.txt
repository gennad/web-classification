One day a farmer called up an engineer, a physicist, and a mathematician
and asked them to fence of the largest possible area with the least
amount of fence.  The engineer made the fence in a circle and
proclaimed that he had the most efficient design.  The physicist made
a long, straight line and proclaimed 'We can assume the length is
infinite...' and pointed out that fencing off half of the Earth was
certainly a more efficient way to do it.  The Mathematician just
laughed at them.  He built a tiny fence around himself and said 'I
declare myself to be on the outside.'
