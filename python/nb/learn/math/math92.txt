              profound implications to all of science."

Physicist:   "Not quite.  Physics is well on its way without those
              mythical `foundations'.  Just give us serviceable mathematics."

Computer Scientist:
             "Who cares? Everything in this Universe seems to be finite
              anyway.  Besides, I'm too busy debugging my Pascal programs."

Mathematician:
             "Forget all that!  Just make your formulae as aesthetically
              pleasing as possible!"
