A group of Polish tourists is flying on a small airplane through the
Grand Canyon on a sightseeing tour.  The tour guide announces: "On the
right of the airplane, you can see the famous Bright Angle Falls."
The tourists leap out of their seats and crowd to the windows on the
right side.  This causes a dynamic imbalance, and the plane violently
rolls to the side and crashes into the canyon wall.  All aboard are
lost.  The moral to this episode is:  always keep your poles off the
right side of the plane.

Caveat:  While this joke mentions Polish people, it is not, in my
opinion, in the category of the infamous Polish jokes.  I hope no one
is offended but only humored.
