An engineer, a mathematician, and a computer programmer are driving
down the road when the car they are in gets a flat tire.  The engineer
says that they should buy a new car.  The mathematician says they
should sell the old tire and buy a new one.  The computer programmer
says they should drive the car around the block and see if the tire
fixes itself.
