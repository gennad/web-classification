A Mathematician (M) and an Engineer (E) attend a lecture by a
Physicist. The topic concerns Kulza-Klein theories involving physical
processes that occur in spaces with dimensions of 11, 12 and even
higher.  The M is sitting, clearly enjoying the lecture, while the E
is frowning and looking generally confused and puzzled.  By the end
the E has a terrible headache.  At the end, the M comments about the
wonderful lecture.  The E says "How do you understand this stuff?"
M: "I just visualize the process."
E: "How can you POSSIBLY visualize something that occurs in
11-dimensional space?"
M: "Easy, first visualize it in N-dimensional space, then let N go to 11."
