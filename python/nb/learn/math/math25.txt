An engineer, a mathematician, and a physicist are staying in three
adjoining cabins at a decrepit old motel.

First the engineer's coffee maker catches fire on the bathroom vanity.
He smells the smoke, wakes up, unplugs it, throws it out the window,
and goes back to sleep.

Later that night the physicist smells smoke too.  He wakes up and sees
that a cigarette butt has set the trash can on fire.  He says to
himself, "Hmm. How does one put out a fire?  One can reduce the
temperature of the fuel below the flash point, isolate the burning
material from oxygen, or both.  This could be accomplished by applying
water."  So he picks up the trash can, puts it in the shower stall,
turns on the water, and, when the fire is out, goes back to sleep.

The mathematician, of course, has been watching all this out the
window.  So later, when he finds that his pipe ashes have set the
bedsheet on fire, he is not in the least taken aback.  He immediately
sees that the problem reduces to one that has already been solved and
goes back to sleep.
