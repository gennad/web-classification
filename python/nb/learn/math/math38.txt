Three standard Peter Lax jokes (heard in his lectures) :

1. What's the contour integral around Western Europe?
        Answer: Zero, because all the Poles are in Eastern Europe!
        Addendum: Actually, there ARE some Poles in Western Europe, but
                  they are removable!

2. An English mathematician (I forgot who) was asked by his very religious
   colleague:
	Do you believe in one God?
	Answer: Yes, up to isomorphism!

3. What is a compact city?
	It's a city that can be guarded by finitely many near-sighted
	policemen!
