An assemblage of the most gifted minds in the world were all posed the
following question:

"What is 2 * 2 ?"

The engineer whips out his slide rule (so it's old) and shuffles it
back and forth, and finally announces "3.99".

The physicist consults his technical references, sets up the problem
on his computer, and announces "it lies between 3.98 and 4.02".

The mathematician cogitates for a while, oblivious to the rest of the
world, then announces: "I don't what the answer is, but I can tell
you, an answer exists!".

Philosopher: "But what do you _mean_ by 2 * 2 ?"

Logician: "Please define 2 * 2 more precisely."

Accountant: Closes all the doors and windows, looks around carefully,
            then asks "What do you _want_ the answer to be?"

Computer Hacker: Breaks into the NSA super-computer and gives the answer.
