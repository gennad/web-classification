Not a joke, but a humorous ditty I heard from some guys in an
engineering fraternity (to the best of my recollection):

I'll do it phonetically:

ee to the ex dee ex,
ee to the why dee why,
sine x, cosine x,
natural log of y,
derivative on the left
derivative on the right
integrate, integrate,
fight! fight! fight!
