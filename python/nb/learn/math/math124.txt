In the bayous of Louisiana, there is a small river called the Dirac.
Many wealthy people have their mansions near its mouth.  One of the
social leaders decided to have a  grand ball.  Being a cousin of the
Governor, she arranged  for a detachment of the state militia to serve
as guards and traffic directors for the big doings.  A captain was
sent over with a small company; naturally he asked if there was enough
room for him and his unit.  The social leader replied, "But of course,
Captain!  It is well known that the Dirac delta function has unit
area."
