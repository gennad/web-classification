A mathematician and a physicist agree to a psychological experiment.
The mathematician is put in a chair in a large empty room and a
beautiful naked woman is placed on a bed at the other end of the room.
The psychologist explains, "You are to remain in your chair.  Every
five minutes, I will move your chair to a position halfway between its
current location and the woman on the bed."  The mathematician looks
at the psychologist in disgust.  "What? I'm not going to go through
this.  You know I'll never reach the bed!"  And he gets up and storms
out.  The psychologist makes a note on his clipboard and ushers the
physicist in.  He explains the situation, and the physicist's eyes
light up and he starts drooling.  The psychologist is a bit confused.
"Don't you realize that you'll never reach her?"  The physicist smiles
and replied, "Of course!  But I'll get close enough for all practical
purposes!"
