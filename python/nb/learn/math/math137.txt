The following is supposedly a true story about Russell.  It isn't
really a math joke since it makes fun of the British hierarchy, but
it's funny anyway....

Around the time when Cold War started, Bertrand Russell was giving a
lecture on politics in England.  Being a leftist in a conservative
women's club, he was not received well at all: the ladies came up to
him and started attacking him with whatever they could get their hands
on.  The guard, being an English gentleman, did not want to be rough
to the ladies and yet needed to save Russell from them.  He said, "But
he is a great mathematician!"  The ladies ignored him.  The guard said
again, "But he is a great philosopher!"  The ladies ignore him again. 
In desperation, finally, he said, "But his brother is an earl!"  Bert
was saved.
