   A housewife, an accountant and a lawyer were asked "How much is 2+2?"
   The housewife replies: "Four!".
   The accountant says: "I think it's either 3 or 4.  Let me run those figures
through my spreadsheet one more time."
   The lawyer pulls the drapes, dims the lights and asks in a hushed voice, "How
much do you want it to be?"
