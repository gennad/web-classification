   A mobster was on trial, facing a possible life sentence, but his lawyer
bribed a juror to hold out for a lesser charge.  After hours of deliberation,
the jury returned a verdict carrying a maximum of ten years in prison.
   Afterward, the lawyer approached the juror.  "You had me so worried!  When
the jury was out so long, I was afraid you couldn't pull it off."
   "I was worried too!" answered the juror.  "The others all wanted to acquit
him!"
