A dying man gathered his Lawyer, Doctor and Clergyman at his bed side and handed
each of them an envelop containing $25,000 in cash.  He made them each promise
that after his death and during his repose, they would place the three envelops
in his coffin.  He told them that he wanted to have enough money to enjoy the
next life.  A week later the man died.  At the Wake, the Lawyer and Doctor and
Clergyman, each concealed an envelop in the coffin and bid their old client and
friend farewell.  By chance, these three met several months later.  Soon the
Clergyman, feeling  guilty, blurted out a confession saying that there was only
$10,000 in the envelop he placed in the coffin.  He felt, rather than waste all
the money, he would send it to a Mission in South America.  He asked for their
forgiveness.  The Doctor, moved by the gentle Clergymans sincerity, confessed
that he too had kept some of the money for a worthy medical charity.  The
envelop, he admitted, had only $8000 in it.  He said, he too could not bring
himself to waste the money so frivolously when it could be used to benefit
others.  By this time the Lawyer was seething with self-righteous outrage.  He
expressed his deep disappointment in the felonious behavior of two of his oldest
and most trusted friends.  I am the only one who kept his promise to our dying
friend.  I want you both to know that the envelop I placed in the coffin
contained the full amount.  Indeed, my envelop contained my personal check for
the entire $25,000.
