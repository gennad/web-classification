                       A Hindi priest, a Muslim priest, and a lawyer are traveling
                       across the country together. In the middle of Kansas, their
                       car breaks down, so they push it to the nearest farm to fix it,
                       but it gets dark by then. They ask the farmer if they can
                       spend the night, and he says, 'Yup. We gots us a guest bed
                       that will hold two of yer, but one of y'uall gonna have to
                       sleep in the barn.' The travelers agree to this and the Hindi
                       voulenteers to sleep in the barn. The lawyer and the Muslim
                       go up to the guest room and start to get ready for bed, but
                       five minutes later, they hear a knock on the door. Its the
                       Hindu, who says, 'Guys, I was lying down to go to sleep, but
                       then I see this cow near me, and my religion won't allow me
                       to sleep under the same roof as a cow.' The Muslim
                       understands, so he voulenteers, but five minutes later, when
                       the Hindi and lawyer are getting ready for bed, there's
                       another knock on the door. It's the Muslim, and he says,
                       'Hey, I'm truly sorry, but I was going to sleep when this pig
                       started oinking near me, and my religion won't let me sleep
                       near a pig.' The laywer finally agrees to sleep in the barn,
                       although a little reluctantly. Five minutes later, there's
                       another knock on the door. It's the cow and pig.
