The receptionist at the lawyers office answers her phone, "Johnson and
Lewis, attorneys at law.""Let me speak with Mr. Johnson please," said the
caller. "I'm sorry, Mr. Johnson passed away last night," replied the
receptionist. A few minutes later, she receives another call from what
sounds like the same caller. "May I speak with Mr. Johnson please?" "I'm
sorry, sir, but Mr. Johnson died last night." When the phone rings for the
third time, the receptionist hears the same voice. "May I speak with Mr.
Johnson please?" "Sir, I don't know what you're up to, but I recognize your
voice and I've already told you twice that Mr. Johnson died last night!"
snapped the receptionist. "I know, I'm sorry, I can't help myself," said the
caller, "I just love hearing you say it over and over again."
