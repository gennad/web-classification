   A lawyer named Strange was shopping for a tombstone.  After he had made his
selection, the stonecutter asked him what inscription he would like on it.
   "Here lies an honest man and a lawyer," responded the lawyer.
   "Sorry, but I can't do that," replied the stonecutter.  "In this state, it's
against the law to bury two people in the same grave.  However, I could put
"here lies an honest lawyer."
   "But that won't let people know who it is" protested the lawyer.
   "Certainly will," retorted the stonecutter.  "People will read it and
exclaim, "That's strange!"
