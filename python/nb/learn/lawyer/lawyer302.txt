   A truck driver used to amuse himself by running over lawyers he would see
walking down the side of the road.  Every time he would see a lawyer walking
along the road, he would swerve to hit him, and there would be a loud "THUMP"
and then he would swerve back on the road.  This pasttime was immensely
enjoyable to the truck driver.
   One day, as the truck driver was driving along, he saw a priest hitchhiking,
so he thought he would do a good turn by offering the priest a lift.  He pulled
the truck over and asked the priest, "Where are you going, Father?"
   "I'm going to the church 5 miles down the road!" replied the priest.
   "No problem, Father!  I'll give you a lift.  Climb in the truck."
   With that, the happy priest climbed into the passenger seat, and the truck
driver continued down the road.
   Suddenly, the truck driver saw a lawyer walking down the road, and
instinctively he swerved to hit him.  But then he remembered there was a priest
in the truck with him, so at the last minute he swerved back to the road,
narrowly missing the lawyer.  However, even though he was certain he missed the
lawyer, he still heard a loud "THUD".
   Not understanding where the noise came from he glanced in his mirrors, and
when he didn't see anything, he turned to the priest and said, "I'm sorry,
Father.  I almost hit that lawyer."
   "That's okay," replied the priest. "I got him with the door!"
