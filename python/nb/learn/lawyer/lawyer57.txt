A lawyer and an engineer were fishing in the Caribbean. The lawyer said "I'm
here because my house burned down and everything I owned was destroyed by
the fire. The insurance company paid for everything."
"That's quite a coincidence", said the engineer, "I'm here because my house
and all my belongings were destroyed by a flood, and my insurance company
also paid for everything." The lawyer looked somewhat confused. "How do you
start a flood?", he asked.
