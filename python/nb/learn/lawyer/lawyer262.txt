   At a convention of biological scientists, one researcher remarks to another,
"Did you know that in our lab we have switched from mice to lawyers for our
experiments?"
   "Really?"  the other replied, "Why did you switch?"
   "Well, for five reasons. First, we found that lawyers are far more plentiful.
Second, the lab assistants don't get so attached to them.  Third, lawyers
multiply faster in numbers,  Fourth, animal rights groups will not object to
their torture.  And fifth, there are some things even a rat won't do.  There is
a drawback however; sometimes it's very hard to extrapolate the test results to
human beings"

Why do behavioral scientists prefer lawyers to rats for their experiments?
There are more of the lawyers to work with, lab assistants are less likely to
feel sympathy for them, they multiply faster, animal rights groups will not
object to their torture, and there are some things even a rat won't do.
