The Lawyer's Motto:
   "Insofar as manifestations of functional deficiencies are agreed by any and
all concerned parties to be imperceivable, and are so stipulated, it is
incumbent upon said heretofore mentioned parties to exercise the deferment of
otherwise pertinent maintenance procedures."

In Other Words:
   "If it ain't broke, don't fix it."
