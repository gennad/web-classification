Carlson was charged with stealing a Mercedes Benz, and after a long trial, the
jury acquitted him.  Later that day Carlson came back to the judge who had
presided at the hearing.
    "Your honor," he said, "I wanna get out a warrant for that dirty lawyer of
mine."
    "Why ?" asked the judge. "He won your acquittal.  What do you want to have
him arrested for ?"
    "Well, your honor," replied Carlson, "I didn't have the money to pay his
fee, so he went and took the car I stole."
