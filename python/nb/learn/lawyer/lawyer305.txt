   Experts are people who know a great deal about very little and who go along
learning more and more about less and less until they know practically
everything about nothing.
   Lawyers, on the other hand, are people who know very little about many things
and keep learning less and less about more and more until they know practically
nothing about everything.
   Judges are people who start out knowing everything about everything but end
up knowing nothing about anything because of their constant association with
experts and lawyers.
