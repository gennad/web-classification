A Farmer walked into an attorney's office wanting to file for a divorce.
The Attorney asked "May I help you?".
The Farmer said "Yea, I want to get one of those dayvorce's."
The Attorney said "Do you have any grounds?"
The Farmer said "Yea, I got about 140 acres."
The Attorney said "No, you don't understand, do you have a case?"
The Farmer said "No, I got a John Deere."
The Attorney said, "No, you don't understand, I mean do you have a grudge?"
The Farmer said, "Yeh, I got a grudge, that's where I park my John Deere."
The Attorney said "No Sir, I mean do you have a suit?"
The Farmer said, "Yes Sir, I got a suit, I wear it to Church ever' Sunday."
The Attorney said, "Well Sir, does your wife beat you up or anything?"
The Farmer said, "No Sir, we both get up at 4:30 A.M. together."
The Attorney then said, "Well is she a nagger or anything?"
The Farmer said, "No, she's a little white gal, but our last kid was a nagger
and that's why I want this Dayvorce!"
