                       A group of monkeys watch in amazement as a tiger comes
                       bouncing out of the jungle, runs over to a pile of their shit
                       and starts to gobble it up. They ask the tiger: "Why are you
                       eating our shit?" The tiger wipes his mouth and answers: "I
                       just ate a lawyer and wanted to get the taste out of my
                       mouth..."
