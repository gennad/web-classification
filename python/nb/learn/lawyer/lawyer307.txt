   A very good man dies, and as a reward for a life well-spent, goes to heaven.
When he arrives, St. Peter meets him at the gate.
   "Welcome," says St. Peter, "since you were such a good person in life, you
may enter heaven."
   "Thank you," said the man.  "But before I come in, could you tell me what
kind of other people are here?"
   "Well, all kinds," replied St. Peter.
   "Are there any convicted criminals in heaven?" asked the man.
   "Yes, some," said St. Peter.
   "Are there any communists in heaven?" asked the man.
   "Yes, there are," replied St. Peter.
   "Are there any Nazis in heaven?  Asked the man.
   "Just a few," said St. Peter.
   "Well, are there any lawyers in heaven?" asked the man.
   St. Peter replied "What, and ruin it for everyone else?"
