   It seems that a devout, good couple was about to get married, but a tragic
car accident ended their lives.
   When they got to heaven, they asked St. Peter if he could arrange for them to
be married, saying that it was what they had hoped for in life, and they still
desired wedded union.  He thought about it and agreed, but said they would have
to wait.
   It was almost one hundred years later when St. Peter sent for them.  They
were married in a simple ceremony.
   So things went on, for thirty years or so, but they determined, in this time,
that eternity was best not spent together.
   They went back to St. Peter, and said, "We thought we would be happy forever,
but now we believe that we have irreconcilable differences.  Is there any way we
can get divorced?"
   "Are you kidding?" said St. Peter.  "It took me a hundred years to get a
priest up here to marry you.  I'll never get a lawyer!"
