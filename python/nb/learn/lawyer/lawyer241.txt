   The Pope and a lawyer find themselves together before the Pearly Gates. After
a small quantum of time which was spent discussing their respective professions,
ol' St. Peter shows up to usher them to their new Heavenly station.  After
passing out wings, harps, halos and such, St. Pete decides to show them to their
new lodgings.  Only a brief flight from the welcome, Pete brings them down on
the front lawn of a huge palatial estate with all sorts of lavish trappings.
This, Pete announces, is where the lawyer will be spending eternity, (at least
until the end of time..)  "Hot Dang", the Pope says to His-self, "If he's
getting a place like this, I can hardly wait to see my digs!".  They take flight
once again, and as Pete leads on, the landscape below begins to appear more and
more mundane until they finally land on a street lined with Brownstone houses.
Pete indicates the third walkup on the left as the Popes new domicile and turns
to leave, wishing the pontiff all his best.  The Pope, in a mild state of
astonishment, cries out "Hey Pete!  What's the deal here?  You put that lawyer
in a beautiful estate home and I, spiritual leader of terra-firma, end up with
this dive?"  Pete looks at the pontiff amusedly and replys: "Look here old
fellow, this street is practically encrusted with spiritual leaders from many
times and religions.  We're putting you here with them so you guys can get your
dogma together. That other guy gets an estate, because he's the first non-damned
lawyer to make it up here!!"
