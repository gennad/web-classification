                       There was a truck driver who couldn't stand lawyers.
                       Whenever he saw one on the side of the road he would he
                       swerve to hit the lawyer. One day he saw a preist on the side
                       off the road so he pulled over, "Where are you headed,
                       father" he asked. The preist replied, "The church 5 miles up
                       the road." "Well, I can give you a ride." So, the preist got in
                       and on the way they spotted a lawyer. Instinctivly the driver
                       swerved towards him, but remembering that he had a preist
                       in the cab he turned back missing the lawyer by inches.
                       Although he knew he missed the lawyer he still heard a
                       "THUD" he turned to the preist and said "I'm sorry, father, I
                       almost hit that lawyer." The preist replied, "Thats okay, Igot
                       him with the door."
