   A Russian, a Cuban, an American and a Lawyer are in a train.  The Russian
takes a bottle of the Best Vodka out of his pack; pours some into a glass,
drinks it, and says: "In USSR, we have the best vodka of the world, nowhere in
the world you can find vodka as good as the one we produce in Ukrainia.  And we
have so much of it, that we can just throw it away..." Saying that, he open the
window and throw the rest of the bottle through it.  All the others are quite
impressed.
   The Cuban takes a pack of Havanas, takes one of them, lights it and begins to
smoke it saying: "In Cuba, we have the best cigars of the world: Havanas,
nowhere in the world there is so many and so good cigar and we have so much of
them, that we can just throw them away...".  Saying that, he throws the pack of
havanas through the window.  One more time, everybody is quite impressed.
   At this time, the American just stands up, opens the window, and throws the
Lawyer through it...
