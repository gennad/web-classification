Star Trek Lawyer Joke

Dr. McCoy was involved in a shuttle craft accident and he was left trapped
inside the damaged ship.  While Captain Kirk was waiting for the emergency crews
to free his comrade he pounded on the ship and shouted, "Bones, Bones!  Do you
think your alright?  Are you badly hurt?"  To which Dr. McCoy replied, "Damn it,
Jim!  How should I know?  I'm a doctor, I'm not a lawyer!"
