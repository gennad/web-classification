As Mr. Smith was on his death bed, he attempted to formulate a plan that
would allow him to take at least some of his considerable wealth with him.
He called for the three men he trusted most - his lawyer, his doctor, and
his clergyman. He told them, "I'm going to give you each $30,000 in cash
before I die. At my funeral, I want you to place the money in my coffin so
that I can try to take it with me."
All three agreed to do this and were given the money. At the funeral, each
approached the coffin in turn and placed an envelope inside. While riding in
the limousine back from the cemetery, the clergyman said, "I have to confess
something to you fellows. Brother Smith was a good churchman all his life,
and I know he would have wanted me to do this. The Church needed a new
baptistery very badly, and I took $10,000 of the money he gave me and bought
one. I only put $20,000 in the coffin."
The physician then said, "Well, since we're confiding in one another, I
might as well tell you that I didn't put the full $30,000 in the coffin
either. Smith had a disease that could have been diagnosed sooner if I had
this very new machine, but the machine cost $20,000 and I couldn't afford it
then. I used $20,000 of the money to buy the machine so that I might be able
to save another patient. I know that Smith would have wanted me to do that."
