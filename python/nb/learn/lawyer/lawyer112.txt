                       There was a Truck Driver named joe ,who loved to run over
                       all the laywers he saw walking on the side of the road!,so one
                       day he was driving up the road when he saw a Priest!,so he
                       said to the priest, do you need a lift?,the Priest replied yes!,so
                       the priest got into the truck and they started to drive up the
                       road when joe saw a lawyer,and he went to swerve to hit
                       him but he just remembered that there was a Priest in the
                       truck so he swerved back,but he still heard a big"THUD",so
                       joe said to the priest im sorry but i might have hit a Lawyer
                       walking on the side of the road? the Priest replied,"That's ok
                       i got him with the door"!
