   Two lawyers made a date to have lunch together.  The first person showed up
on time, but the second person didn't show until 1-1/2 hours after they were
supposed to meet...
   1st lawyer: "How come you're so late?"
   2nd lawyer: "Oh, I ran over a milk bottle and got a flat tire.."
   1st lawyer: "A milk bottle?  Didn't you see it in the road?"
   2nd lawyer: "No - the kid had it under his coat..."
