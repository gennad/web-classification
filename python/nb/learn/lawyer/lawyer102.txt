                       offensive attorney calls a Old lady to the stand........ The
                       Offensive Attorney: Mam do you know me? Old woman:
                       Yes I know you well, and frankly you have been a
                       dissapointment to me. You lie and cheat. You beat your wife
                       you sell your friends and you think that you are better than
                       every one. Well the lawyer stunnded for a minute thinks a
                       good stategy. The Offensive Attorney: Mam do you know the

                       him when he was little. I am dissapointed with him as well.

                       vermin and his Law skills are the shabbiest in the state. At

                       to argue soon the judge raps his mallet and calls the two
                       attorneys two the stand. Judge addressing the attorneys: If

                       both in jail for contempt in 5 minutes
