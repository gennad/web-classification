A gang of robbers broke into a lawyer's club by mistake. The old legal lions
gave them a fight for their lives. The gang was very happy to escape. "It
ain't so bad," one crook noted. "We got out with $25 between us." "I warned
you to stay clear of lawyers!", the boss screamed. "We had over $100 when we
broke in!"
