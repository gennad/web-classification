   The October 8, 1990 issue of Fortune has picked up on a small story which
appeared in the Los Angeles Times.
   As best as I remember, there was a lawyer who got caught three times in an
alleged speed trap.  He sued the city under RICO (Racketeering Influence and
Corruption) statutes.  Part of the allegation is that the city set the speed
limit without reviewing the traffic patterns every 5 years.
   A judge ruled that the city could be sued under RICO.
   I doubt that this is what they had in mind when Congress passed the RICO
statutes.
