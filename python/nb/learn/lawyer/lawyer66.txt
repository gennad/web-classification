Sammy came home from first grade with his first homework assignment, which
was to find the answer to "what is 2 + 2?". He went to his father first
because he was a mathematician. His dad said, "That seems to be from the
theory of small sets, which I haven't used in a long time. I suspect that
the answer is greater than 3, and will not exceed 5, even for extremely
large values of 2. I'll write it in Fortran and run it through the computer
at the college in the morning." Sammy shook his head and went outside to
think. His neighbor, an internist, was working in the yard. Sammy went over
and asked, "Dr. Smith, what is 2 + 2?" Smith thought a while and then said,
"I think it is 4, but we should run some tests first. Can you make an
appointment to see me at the office tommorrow and don't forget to bring your
HMO card." Sammy wasn't satisfied and he walked over to the other neighbor's
house, where Mr. Jones, a lawyer, was washing his BMW. Sammy said, "Mr.
Jones, what is 2 + 2?" Jones said, "My boy, since you are my little friend
and neighbor, I will waive my usual consultation fee, this is strictly Pro
Bono. But, be assured that justice will be served and the rights of the
citizen to know the value of 2 + 2 will be upheld". Then he knelt down and
wispered in Sammy's ear. "Sammy, what would you like it to be?"
