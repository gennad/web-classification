There was a young couple, very much in love, who the night before they were
to be married, were both tragically killed in an automobile accident. They
found themselves at the pearly gates of heaven being escorted in by St.
Peter. After a couple of weeks in heaven, the prospective groom took St.
Peter aside and said, "St. Peter, my fiance and I are very happy to be in
heaven but we miss very much the opportunity to have celebrated our wedding
vows. Is it possible for people in heaven to get married?"
St. Peter looked at them solemnly and said, "I tell you what, wait five
years and if you still want to get married, come back and we will talk about
it again."
Well five years went by, and the couple still very much wanting to get
married, came back. Again the St Peter said, "Please, you must wait another
five years and then I will consider your request."
Finally, they come before the St. Peter the third time, ten years after
their first request, and asked him again. This time he answered, "Yes, you
may marry. This Saturday at 2:00 p.m., we will have a beautiful ceremony in
the main chapel. The reception will be on me!"
The wedding went beautifully, all the guests thought the bride was
beautiful. Moses brought some flowers from the Nile River Delta and Ghandi
came wearing his finest hand-woven sari. But, you guessed it, the couple was
married but a few weeks when they realized they had made a horrible mistake,
they just couldn't stay married to one another.
So they made another appointment to see the Lord God Almighty, this time to
ask if they could get a divorce in heaven. When the Lord heard their
request, he looked at them and said, "Look, it took us ten years to find a
priest up here in heaven; do you have any idea how long it'll take to find a
lawyer?"
