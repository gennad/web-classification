                       Once a priest and a lawyer died at the exact same time, and
                       they got switched. The priest went down, and the lawyer
                       went up. When they got unswitched, the met on the elevator.
                       "Oh!" said the priest, "Did you meet god and the virgin
                       Mary" he asked the lawyer. "Yep!" he replied, "but just call
                       her Mary now!"
