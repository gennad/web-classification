   A housewife, an accountant and a lawyer were asked "How much is 2+2?"
   The housewife replies: "Four!".
   The accountant says: "I think it's either 3 or 4.  Let me run those figures
through my spreadsheet one more time."
   The lawyer pulls the drapes, dims the lights and asks in a hushed voice, "How
much do you want it to be?"

A grade school teacher was asking students what their parents did for a living.
"Tim, you be first," she said.  "What does your mother do all day?"  Tim stood
up and proudly said, "She's a doctor."  "That's wonderful. How about you, Amie?"
Amie shyly stood up, scuffed her feet and said, "My father is a mailman." "Thank
you, Amie," said the teacher.  "What about your father, Billy?"  Billy proudly
stood up and announced, "My daddy plays piano in a whorehouse."  The teacher was
aghast and promptly changed the subject to geography.  Later that day she went
to Billy's house and rang the bell.  Billy's father answered the door.  The
teacher explained what his son had said and demanded an explanation.  Billy's
father said, "I'm actually an attorney.  How can I explain a thing like that to
a seven-year-old?"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A lawyer died and arrived at the pearly gates.  To his dismay, there were
thousands of people ahead of him in line to see St. Peter.  To his surprise, St.
Peter left his desk at the gate and came down the long line to where the lawyer
was, and greeted him warmly.  Then St. Peter and one of his assistants took the
lawyer by the hands and guided him up to the front of the line, and into a
comfortable chair by his desk.  The lawyer said, "I don't mind all this
attention, but what makes me so special?"  St. Peter replied, "Well, I've added
up all the hours for which you billed your clients, and by my calculation you
must be about 193 years old!"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   The Pope and a lawyer find themselves together before the Pearly Gates. After
a small quantum of time which was spent discussing their respective professions,
ol' St. Peter shows up to usher them to their new Heavenly station.  After
passing out wings, harps, halos and such, St. Pete decides to show them to their
new lodgings.  Only a brief flight from the welcome, Pete brings them down on
the front lawn of a huge palatial estate with all sorts of lavish trappings.
This, Pete announces, is where the lawyer will be spending eternity, (at least
until the end of time..)  "Hot Dang", the Pope says to His-self, "If he's
getting a place like this, I can hardly wait to see my digs!".  They take flight
once again, and as Pete leads on, the landscape below begins to appear more and
more mundane until they finally land on a street lined with Brownstone houses.
Pete indicates the third walkup on the left as the Popes new domicile and turns
to leave, wishing the pontiff all his best.  The Pope, in a mild state of
astonishment, cries out "Hey Pete!  What's the deal here?  You put that lawyer
in a beautiful estate home and I, spiritual leader of terra-firma, end up with
this dive?"  Pete looks at the pontiff amusedly and replys: "Look here old
fellow, this street is practically encrusted with spiritual leaders from many
times and religions.  We're putting you here with them so you guys can get your
dogma together. That other guy gets an estate, because he's the first non-damned
lawyer to make it up here!!"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   The lawyer is standing at the gate to Heaven and St. Peter is listing his
sins:
   1) Defending a large corporation in a pollution suit where he knew they were
guilty.
   2) Defending an obviously guilty murderer because the fee was high.
   3) Overcharging fees to many clients.
   4) Prosecuting an innocent woman because a scapegoat was needed in a
controversial case.
   And the list goes on for quite awhile.
   The lawyer objects and begins to argue his case.  He admits all these things,
but argues, "Wait, I've done some charity in my life also."  St. Peter looks in
his book and says,"Yes, I see.  Once you gave a dime to a panhandler and once
you gave an extra nickel to the shoeshine boy, correct?" The lawyer gets a smug
look on his face and replies, "Yes."   St. Peter turns to the angel next to him
and says, "Give this guy 15 cents and tell him to go to hell."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A Dublin lawyer died in poverty and many barristers of the city sub- scribed to
a fund for his funeral.  The Lord Chief Justice of Orbury was asked to donate a
shilling.  "Only a shilling?" said the Justice, "Only a shilling to bury an
attorney?  Here's a guinea; go and bury 20 more of them."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

At the funeral of a lady was her doctor, a friend and her lawyer.  Each had
promised her that at her funeral they would toss $1000 into her grave.  The
doctor and friend each tossed in their $1000 cash, after which the lawyer
removed the cash and placed a check for $3000.

Carlson was charged with stealing a Mercedes Benz, and after a long trial, the
jury acquitted him.  Later that day Carlson came back to the judge who had
presided at the hearing.
    "Your honor," he said, "I wanna get out a warrant for that dirty lawyer of
mine."
    "Why ?" asked the judge. "He won your acquittal.  What do you want to have
him arrested for ?"
    "Well, your honor," replied Carlson, "I didn't have the money to pay his
fee, so he went and took the car I stole."

"You seem to have more than the average share of intelligence for a man of your
background," sneered the lawyer at a witness on the stand.  "If I wasn't under

A judge in a semi-small city was hearing a drunk-driving case and the defendant,
who had both a record and a reputation for driving under the influence, demanded
a jury trial.  It was nearly 4 P. M.  And getting a jury would take time, so the
judge called a recess and went out in the hall looking to impanel anyone
available for jury duty.  He found a dozen lawyers in the main lobby and told
them that they were a jury.  The lawyers thought this would be a novel
experience and so followed the judge back to the courtroom.  The trial was over
in about 10 minutes and it was very clear that the defendant was guilty.  The
jury went into the jury-room, the judge started getting ready to go home, and
everyone waited.  After nearly three hours, the judge was totally out of
patience and sent the bailiff into the jury-room to see what was holding up the
verdict.  When the bailiff returned, the judge said, "Well have they got a
verdict yet?"  The bailiff shook his head and said, "Verdict?  Hell, they're
still doing nominating speeches for the foreman's position!"

Diogenes went to look for an honest lawyer. "How's it going?", someone asked.
"Not too bad", said Diogenes. "I still have my lantern."

A woman and her little girl were visiting the grave of the little girl's
grandmother.  On their way through the cemetery back to the car, the little girl
asked, "Mommy, do they ever bury two people in the same grave?"  "Of course not,
dear." replied the mother, "Why would you think that?" "The tombstone back there
said 'Here lies a lawyer and an honest man.'"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The defendant who pleads their own case has a fool for a client, but at
least there will be no problem with fee-splitting.

These two guys, George and Harry, set out in a hot air balloon to cross the
Atlantic Ocean.  After 37 hours in the air, George says "Harry, we better lose
some altitude so we can see where we are".  Harry lets out some of the hot air
in the balloon, and the balloon descends to below the cloud cover.  George says,
"I still can't tell where we are, lets ask that guy on the ground".  So Harry
yells down to the man "Hey, could you tell us where we are?".  And the man on
the ground yells back "You're in a balloon, 100 feet up in the air".  George
turns to Harry and says "That man must be a lawyer".  And Harry says "How can
you tell?".  George says "Because the advice he gave us is 100% accurate, and
totally useless".  That's the end of the Joke, but for you people who are still
worried about George and Harry: They end up in the drink, and make the front
page of the New York Times: "Balloonists Soaked by Lawyer".

Lawyers in Japan

Copied from the Sunday Daily Breeze -

Take heart, America.  Three monkey wrenches have been thrown into Japan's
well-oiled economic machine.  It's only a mater of time before that powerful
engine of productivity begins to sputter and fail.

What could cause such a sharp turnaround?  High interest rates?  Increased
unemployment?  Lower productivity?  No, it's something much more economically
debilitating - and permanent.

Three American lawyers have become the first foreign attorneys permitted to
practice law in Japan.  What's more, two of them are from New York!

The decline has begun.

Japan has one attorney for every 10,000 residents, compared to the U.S. ratio of
one attorney for every 390 residents.  For every 100 attorneys trained in Japan,
there are 1,000 engineers.  In the United States, that ratio is reversed.

But a law that became effective on April 1 permits foreigners to practice in
Japan for the first time since 1955.  Already, an additional 20 American and six
British lawyers have applied for permission to open practices in Japan.

If anything can slow the Japanese economy, it's the presence of American
attorneys.  What better way to even our balance of trade than to send Japan our
costliest surplus commodity?

For three years, the young attorney had been taking his brief vacations at this
country inn.  The last time he'd finally managed an affair with the innkeeper's
daughter.  Looking forward to an exciting few days, he dragged his suitcase up
the stairs of the inn, then stopped short.  There sat his lover with an infant
on her lap!  "Helen, why didn't you write when you learned you were pregnant?"
he cried.  "I would have rushed up here, we could have gotten married, and the
baby would have my name!"  "Well," she said, "when my folks found out about my
condition, we sat up all night talkin' and talkin' and decided it would be
better to have a bastard in the family than a lawyer."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

God decided to take the devil to court and settle their differences once and for
all.  When Satan heard this, he laughed and said, "And where do you think you're
going to find a lawyer?"

Santa Claus, the tooth fairy, an honest lawyer and an old drunk are walking down
the street together when they simultaneously spot a hundred dollar bill.  Who
gets it?  The old drunk, of course, the other three are mythological creatures.

   A lawyer named Strange was shopping for a tombstone.  After he had made his
selection, the stonecutter asked him what inscription he would like on it.
   "Here lies an honest man and a lawyer," responded the lawyer.
   "Sorry, but I can't do that," replied the stonecutter.  "In this state, it's
against the law to bury two people in the same grave.  However, I could put
"here lies an honest lawyer."
   "But that won't let people know who it is" protested the lawyer.
   "Certainly will," retorted the stonecutter.  "People will read it and
exclaim, "That's strange!"

   "Doctor," she asks nervously, "Can you get pregnant from anal intercourse?"
   "Certainly," replies the doctor, "Where do you think lawyers come from?"

   At a convention of biological scientists, one researcher remarks to another,
"Did you know that in our lab we have switched from mice to lawyers for our
experiments?"
   "Really?"  the other replied, "Why did you switch?"
   "Well, for five reasons. First, we found that lawyers are far more plentiful.
Second, the lab assistants don't get so attached to them.  Third, lawyers
multiply faster in numbers,  Fourth, animal rights groups will not object to
their torture.  And fifth, there are some things even a rat won't do.  There is
a drawback however; sometimes it's very hard to extrapolate the test results to
human beings"

Why do behavioral scientists prefer lawyers to rats for their experiments?
There are more of the lawyers to work with, lab assistants are less likely to
feel sympathy for them, they multiply faster, animal rights groups will not
object to their torture, and there are some things even a rat won't do.

   A little old lady walked into the head branch of the Chase Manhattan Bank
holding a large paper bag in her hand.  She told the young man at the window
that she wished to take the 3 million she had in the bag and open an account
with the bank.  She said that first, though, she wished to meet the president of
Chase Manhattan Bank due to the amount of money involved.  The teller seemed to
think that was a reasonable request and after opening the paper bag and seeing
the bundles of 1,000 bills which amounted to right around 3 million, telephoned
the bank's secretary to obtain an appointment for the lady.
   The lady was escorted upstairs and ushered into the president's office.
Introductions were made and she stated that she would like to get to know the
people she did business with on a more personal level.  The bank president then
asked her where she came into such a large amount of money. "Was it an
inheritance?" he asked. "No." she answered.  "Was it from playing the stock
market?"  "No." she replied.  He was quiet for a minute, trying to think of
where this little old lady could possibly come into 3 million.  "I bet." she
stated.  "You bet?" repeated the bank president.  "As in horses?"  "No." she
replied, "I bet people."  Seeing his confusion, she explained that she justs
bets different things with people.  All of a sudden she said, "I'll bet you
$25,000.00 that by 10:00 o'clock tomorrow morning, your balls will be square."
The bank president figured she must be off her rocker and decided to take her up
on the bet.  He didn't see how he could lose.  For the rest of the day, the bank
president was very careful.  He decided to stay home that evening and take no
chances; there was $25,000.00 at stake.
   When he got up in the morning and took his shower, he checked to make sure
everything was okay.  There was no difference- he looked the same as he always
had.  He went to work and waited for the little old lady to come in at 10:00
o'clock, humming as he went.  He knew this would be a good day- how often do you
get handed $25,000.00 for doing nothing.  At 10:00 o'clock sharp the little old
lady was shown into his office.  With her was a younger man. When he inquired as
to the man's purpose for being there, she informed him that he was her lawyer
and she always took him along when there was this much money involved.  "Well,"
she asked, "what about our bet?"  "I don't know how to tell you this," he
replied, "but I am the same as I've always been only $25,000.00 richer."  The
lady seemed to accept this, but requested that she be able to see for herself.
The bank president thought this was reasonable and dropped his trousers. She
instructed him to bend over and then grabbed a hold of him.  Sure enough,
everything was fine.  The bank president then looked up and saw her lawyer
standing across the room banging his head against the wall.  "What' wrong with
him?" he inquired.  "Oh him,"  she replied, "I bet him $100,000.00 that by 10:00
o'clock this morning that I'd have the president of Chase Manhattan Bank by the
balls."

A certain lawyer was quite wealthy and had a summer house in the country, to
which he retreated for several weeks of the year.  Each summer, the lawyer would
invite a different friend of his (no, that's not the punch line) to spend a week
or two up at this place, which happened to be in a backwoods section of Maine.
On one particular occasion, he invited a Czechoslovakian friend to stay with
him.  The friend, eager to get a freebee off a lawyer, agreed.  Well, they had a
splendid time in the country - rising early and living in the great outdoors.
Early one morning, the lawyer and his Czechoslovakian companion went out to pick
berries for their morning breakfast.  As they went around the berry patch,
gathering blueberries and raspberries in tremendous quantities, along came two
huge Bears - a male and a female.  Well, the lawyer, seeing the two bears,
immediately dashed for cover.  His friend, though, wasn't so lucky, and the male
bear reached him and swallowed him whole.  The lawyer ran back to his Mercedes,
tore into town as fast has he could, and got the local backwoods sheriff.  The
sheriff grabbed his shotgun and dashed back to the berry patch with the lawyer.
Sure enough, the two bears were still there.  "He's in THAT one!" cried the
lawyer, pointing to the male, while visions of lawsuits from his friend's family
danced in his head.  He just had to save his friend.  The sheriff looked at the
bears, and without batting an eye, leveled his gun, took careful aim, and SHOT
THE FEMALE.  "Whatdya do that for!" exclaimed the lawyer, "I said he was in the
other!" "Exactly," replied the sheriff, "and would YOU believe a lawyer who told
you that the Czech was in the Male?"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   It had to happen sooner or later.  Lawyer Dobbins was wheeled into the
emergency room on a stretcher, rolling his head in agony.  Doctor Green came
over to see him.
  "Dobbins," he said, "What an honor.  The last time I saw you was in court when
you accused me of malpractice."
  "Doc.  Doc.  My side is on fire.  The pain is right here.  What could it be?"
  "How would I know?  You told the jury I wasn't fit to be a doctor."
  "I was only kidding, Doc.  When you represent a client you don't know what
you're saying.  Could I be passing a kidney stone?"
  "Your diagnosis is as good as mine."
  "What are you talking about?"
  "When you questioned me on the stand you indicated you knew everything there
was to know about the practice of medicine."
  "Doc, I'm climbing the wall.  Give me something."
  "Let's say I give you something for a kidney stone and it turns out to be a
gallstone.  Who is going to pay for my court costs?"
  "I'll sign a paper that I won't sue."
  "Can I read to you from the transcript of the trial?  Lawyer Dobbins: 'Why
were you so sure that my client had tennis elbow?'  Dr. Green: 'I've treated
hundreds of people with tennis elbow and I know it when I see it.'  Dobbins: 'It
never occurred to you my client could have an Excedrin headache?'  Green: 'No,
there were no signs of an Excedrin headache.'  Dobbins: 'You and your ilk make
me sick.' "
  "Why are you reading that to me?"
  "Because, Dobbins, since the trial I've lost confidence in making a diagnosis.
A lady cane in the other day limping ..."
  "Please, Doc, I don't want to hear it now.  Give me some Demerol."
  "You said during the suit that I dispensed drugs like a drunken sailor.  I've
changed my ways, Dobbins.  I don't prescribe drugs anymore."
  "Then get me another doctor."
  "There are no other doctors on duty.  The reason I'm here is that after the
malpractice suit the sheriff seized everything in my office.  This is the only
place that I can practice."
  "If you give me something to relieve the pain I will personally appeal your
case to a higher court."
  "You know, Dobbins, I was sure that you were a prime candidate for a kidney
stone."
  "You can't tell a man is a candidate for a kidney stone just by looking at
him."
  "That's what you think, Dobbins.  You had so much acid in you when you
addressed the jury I knew some of it eventually had to crystallize into stones.
Remember on the third day day when you called me the 'Butcher of Operating Room
6'?  That afternoon I said to my wife, "That man is going to be in a lot of
pain.' "
  "Okay, Doc, you've had your ounce of flesh.  Can I now have my ounce of
Demerol?"
  "I better check you out first."
  "Don't check me out, just give the dope."
  "But in court the first question you asked me was if I had examined the
patient completely.  It would be negligent of me if I didn't do it now.  Do you
mind getting up on the scale?"
  "What for?"
  "To find out your height.  I have to be prepared in case I get sued and the
lawyer asks me if I knew how tall you were."
  "I'm not going to sue you."
  "You say that now.  But how can I be sure you won't file a writ after you pass
the kidney stone?"

   A Russian, a Cuban, an American and a Lawyer are in a train.  The Russian
takes a bottle of the Best Vodka out of his pack; pours some into a glass,
drinks it, and says: "In USSR, we have the best vodka of the world, nowhere in
the world you can find vodka as good as the one we produce in Ukrainia.  And we
have so much of it, that we can just throw it away..." Saying that, he open the
window and throw the rest of the bottle through it.  All the others are quite
impressed.
   The Cuban takes a pack of Havanas, takes one of them, lights it and begins to
smoke it saying: "In Cuba, we have the best cigars of the world: Havanas,
nowhere in the world there is so many and so good cigar and we have so much of
them, that we can just throw them away...".  Saying that, he throws the pack of
havanas through the window.  One more time, everybody is quite impressed.
   At this time, the American just stands up, opens the window, and throws the
Lawyer through it...

A lawyer's dog, running about unleashed, beelines for a butcher shop and steals
a roast.  Butcher goes to lawyer's office and asks, "if a dog running unleashed
steals a piece of meat from my store, do I have a right to demand payment for
the meat from the dog's owner?"  The lawyer answers, "Absolutely." "Then you owe
me $8.  50.  Your dog was loose and stole a roast from me today." The lawyer,
without a word, writes the butcher a check for $8.  50 [attorneys don't carry
cash - it's too plebeian - and the butcher hadn't brought the shop's credit card
imprinter to the lawyer's office].  Several periods of time later - it could be
the next day but that would be unrealistic - the butcher opens the mail and
finds an envelope from the lawyer: $20 due for a consultation.

   A Rabbi, a Hindu and a lawyer were driving late at night in the country when
their car expired.  They set out to find help, and came to a farmhouse.  When
they knocked at the door, the farmer explained that he had only two beds, and
one of the three had to sleep in the barn with the animals.  The three quickly
agreed.
   The Rabbi said he would sleep in the barn and let the other two have the
beds.  Ten minutes after the Rabbi left, there was a knock on the bedroom door.
The Rabbi entered exclaiming "I can't sleep in the barn; there is a pig in
there.  It's against my religion to sleep in the same room with a pig!"
   The Hindu said he would sleep in the barn, as he had no religious problem
with pigs.  However, about five minutes later, the Hindu burst through the
bedroom door saying "There's a cow in the barn!  I can't sleep in the same room
as a cow!  It's against my religion!"
   The lawyer, anxious to get to sleep, said he'd go to the barn, as he had no

How many lawyers does it take to change a light bulb?

   A1: It only takes one lawyer to change your light bulb to his light bulb.
   A2: You won't find a lawyer who can change a light bulb.  Now, if you're
       looking for a lawyer to screw a light bulb...
   A3: Whereas the party of the first part, also known as "Lawyer", and the
party of the second part, also known as "Light Bulb", do hereby and forthwith
agree to a transaction wherein the party of the second part (Light Bulb) shall
be removed from the current position as a result of failure to perform
previously agreed upon duties, i. e., the lighting, elucidation, and otherwise
illumination of the area ranging from the front (north) door, through the
entryway, terminating at an area just inside the primary living area, demarcated
by the beginning of the carpet, any spillover illumination being at the option
of the party of the second part (Light Bulb) and not required by the
aforementioned agreement between the parties.
   The aforementioned removal transaction shall include, but not be limited to,
the following steps:
   1.) The party of the first part (Lawyer) shall, with or without elevation at
his option, by means of a chair, stepstool, ladder or any other means of
elevation, grasp the party of the second part (Light Bulb) and rotate the party
of the second part (Light Bulb) in a counter-clockwise direction, this point
being non-negotiable.
   2.) Upon reaching a point where the party of the second part (Light Bulb)
becomes separated from the party of the third part ("Receptacle"), the party of
the first part (Lawyer) shall have the option of disposing of the party of the
second part (Light Bulb) in a manner consistent with all applicable state, local
and federal statutes.
   3.) Once separation and disposal have been achieved, the party of the first
part (Lawyer) shall have the option of beginning installation of the party of
the fourth part ("New Light Bulb").  This installation shall occur in a manner
consistent with the reverse of the procedures described in step one of this
self-same document, being careful to note that the rotation should occur in a
clockwise direction, this point also being non-negotiable.
   Note: The above described steps may be performed, at the option of the party
of the first part (Lawyer), by any or all persons authorized by him, the
objective being to produce the most possible revenue for the party of the fifth
part, also known as "Partnership."

   A doctor, an engineer, and a lawyer go out hunting in the woods one day.
Each of them brings along his hunting dog, and they spend most of the morning
arguing about which of the dogs is the smartest.  Early in the afternoon, they
discover a clearing in the forest.  In the middle of the clearing is a large
pile of animal bones.
   Seeing the bones, the doctor turns to the others and says, "I'm going to
prove to you two that my dog is the smartest.  Watch this!"  He then calls his
dog over and says, "Bones!  See the bones?  Go get 'em!"  The dog rushes over to
the pile, rummages around for a bit, and then proceeds to build a replica of the
human skeleton, perfect down to the last detail.  The doctor grins smugly; after
all, his dog has just build a *human* skeleton from *animal* bones.
   The engineer, however, is totally unimpressed.  "That's nothing," he says.
"Watch this."  He calls his dog over, and points out the pile.  "Bones!  Get the
bones!"  The dog rushes over, tears down the skeleton, and in its place builds a
perfect replica of the Eiffel Tower.  It even has a little French flag waving at
the top.  The doctor is forced to agree that the engineer's dog is, in fact,
smarter than his own.
   The lawyer, however, is still not impressed.  "My dog is smarter," he says.
"Watch."  He then calls his dog over, points to the pile, and says simply
"Bones."  The dog rushes over to the pile, tears down the tower, eats half the
bones, buries the other half, screws the other two dogs, and takes the rest of
the afternoon off.

   Two lawyers made a date to have lunch together.  The first person showed up

supposed to meet...
   1st lawyer: "How come you're so late?"
   2nd lawyer: "Oh, I ran over a milk bottle and got a flat tire.."
   1st lawyer: "A milk bottle?  Didn't you see it in the road?"
   2nd lawyer: "No - the kid had it under his coat..."

There was a young man shipwrecked on an island.  He found a magic lamp on the
shore one day, picked it up and rubbed it.  A Genie appeared.  However, he was
not a typical Genie, he was an attorney Genie.  When the Genie told the man he
was also an attorney the man laughed and said, "Oh come on, Genies can't be
attorneys too!"  The Genie said he would prove it.  He told the man to make his
three wishes, but on one condition, for every wish he made, all attorneys were
granted DOUBLE of what the man wished for.  The man pondered the offer and
decided that something was better than nothing and decided his three wishes. "My
first wish is for 1 million dollars".  The Genie reminded the man that he would
grant the wish, but all attorneys would get double that amount.  The man agreed
and then made his second wish.  "My second wish is for a beautiful blonde with
blue eyes."  Once again the Genie granted the wish and also granted all
attorneys with two of the blonde eyed babe.  The Genie announced that the man
had one more wish and to consider his choice carefully.  The man thought for a
moment.  Suddenly he drew the Genie's attention to a piece of driftwood lying on
the beach.  He told the Genie: "For my next wish, please pick up that piece of
driftwood and beat me HALF to death!!!"

Two lawyers are in a bank, when, suddenly, armed robbers burst in.  While
several of the robbers take the money from the tellers, others line the
customers, including the lawyers, up against a wall, and proceed to take their

in lawyer number two's hand.  Without looking down, lawyer number two whispers,
"What is this?", to which lawyer number one replies, "it's that $50 I owe you."

A lawyer was trying to console a weeping widow.  Her husband had passed away
without a will.  "Did the deceased have any last words?" asked the lawyer. "You
mean *right* before he died?" sobbed the widow.  "Yes," replied the lawyer.
"They might be helpful if it's not too painful for you to recall."  "Well," she
began, "he said "Don't try to scare me!  You couldn't hit the broad side of a

Dear Prospective Employer:

I am a starving student on the 1993 production line at Harvard Law Factory.  A
recent examination of my aspirations has convinced me that I must eat in the
years to come.  The exorbitant sums paid by most legal factories to summer
associates fit in well with the modest goals I have set for myself.  Feel
assured that I understand the responsibilities incumbent upon a summer associate
at your firm.  I am not at all squeamish about milking our powerful corporate
clients of their every last cent by providing legal services of the calibre
necessary to defeat well-founded claims by victims caught in the corporate vice.
I have learned much at Hahvahd.  I can promise that such human foibles as pity
will never interfere with my willingness to stretch the innocent on the rack of
legal trickery for the good of the client and its share-holders.

Although my parents lost their fortune in the 1987 stock market crash, we have
managed to retain our insultingly extravagant La Jolla mansion by means of lies
and trickery.  I have gained a deep admiration for conspicuous consumption and
hope to become an expert in the practice.  If I may quote the Bible, "You cannot
serve both God and Mammon." (Matt. 6:24).  So why bother serving God?

I would be delighted to discuss further my background in a personal interview.
I am satisfied by my ability to demonstrate the amorality needed to be a
successful attorney, and the hunger needed to be a successful and profitable
hour biller with your factory.  I appreciate the time spent reading this form
letter and my "you've seen it all before" resume.  I look forward to receiving a
form letter with good news from you soon!

Desperately, but cocksurely,

A dying man gathered his Lawyer, Doctor and Clergyman at his bed side and handed
each of them an envelop containing $25,000 in cash.  He made them each promise
that after his death and during his repose, they would place the three envelops
in his coffin.  He told them that he wanted to have enough money to enjoy the
next life.  A week later the man died.  At the Wake, the Lawyer and Doctor and
Clergyman, each concealed an envelop in the coffin and bid their old client and
friend farewell.  By chance, these three met several months later.  Soon the
Clergyman, feeling  guilty, blurted out a confession saying that there was only
$10,000 in the envelop he placed in the coffin.  He felt, rather than waste all
the money, he would send it to a Mission in South America.  He asked for their
forgiveness.  The Doctor, moved by the gentle Clergymans sincerity, confessed
that he too had kept some of the money for a worthy medical charity.  The
envelop, he admitted, had only $8000 in it.  He said, he too could not bring
himself to waste the money so frivolously when it could be used to benefit
others.  By this time the Lawyer was seething with self-righteous outrage.  He
expressed his deep disappointment in the felonious behavior of two of his oldest
and most trusted friends.  I am the only one who kept his promise to our dying
friend.  I want you both to know that the envelop I placed in the coffin
contained the full amount.  Indeed, my envelop contained my personal check for
the entire $25,000.

   One evening, after attending the theater, two gentlemen were walking down the
avenue when they observed a rather well dressed and attractive young lady
walking ahead of them.  One of them turned to the other and remarked, "I'd give
$50.00 to spend the night with that woman."  Much to their surprise, the young
lady overheard the remark, turned around, and replied, "I'll take you up on
that."  She had a neat appearance and a pleasant voice, so after bidding his
companion good night, the man accompanied the young lady to her apartment.  The
following morning, the man presented her with $25.  00 as he prepared to leave.
She demanded the rest of the money, stating: "If you don't give me the other
$25.00, I'll sue you for it."  He laughed, saying: "I'd like to see you get it
on these grounds."
   The next day he was surprised when he received a summons ordering his
presence in court as a defendant in a lawsuit.  He hurried to his lawyer and
explained the details of the case.  His lawyer said: "She can't possibly get a
judgement against you on such grounds, but it will be interesting to see how her
case will be presented."
   After the usual preliminaries, the lady's lawyer addressed the court as
follows: "Your honor, my client, this lady, is the owner of a piece of property,
a garden spot, surrounded by a profuse growth of shrubbery, which property she
agreed to rent to the defendant for a specified length of time for the sum of
$50.00.  The defendant took possession of the property, used it extensively for
the purpose for which it was rented, but upon evacuating the premises, he paid
only $25.00, one-half the amount agreed upon.  The rent was not excessive, since
it is restricted property, and we ask judgement be granted against the defendant
to assure payment of the balance." The defendant's lawyer was impressed and
amused by the way his opponent had presented the case.  His defense, therefore,
was somewhat different from the way he originally planned to present it.  "Your
honor," he said, "My client agrees that the lady has a fine piece of property,
that he did rent such property for a time, and a degree of pleasure was derived
from the transaction.  However, my client found a well on the property around
which he placed his own stones, sunk a shaft, and erected a pump, all labor
performed personally by him.  We claim these improvements to the property were
sufficient to offset the unpaid amount, and that the plaintiff was adequately
compensated for rental of said property.  We, therefore, ask that judgement not
be granted."  The young lady's lawyer answered thusly: "Your honor, my client
agrees that the defendant did find a well on her property.  However, had the
defendant not known that the well existed, he would never have rented the
property.  Also, upon evacuating the premises, the defendant removed the stones,
pulled out the shaft, and took the pump with him.  In doing so, he not only
dragged the equipment through the shrubbery, but left the hole much larger than
it was prior to his occupancy, making the property much less desirable to
others.  We, therefore, ask that judgement be granted."
   And it was.  She won the case...

   "You are a cheat!" shouted the attorney to his opponent.
   "And you're a liar!" bellowed the opposition.

   In the middle of the night, in the middle of nowhere, two cars both slightly
cross over the white line in the center of the road.  They collide and a fair
amount of damage is done, although neither is hurt.  It is impossible to assess
blame for the accident on either however.
   They both get out.  One is a doctor and the other is a lawyer.  The lawyer
calls the police on his car phone; they'll be there in 20 minutes.
   It's cold and damp, and both men are shaken up.  The laywer offers the doctor
a drink of brandy from his hip flask, the doctor accepts, drinks and hands it
back to the lawyer, who puts it away.
   "Aren't you also going to have a drink?" the doctor says.
   "AFTER the police get here." replies the lawyer.

   Sam Cohen, father of 3 and faithful husband for over 40 years, unexpectedly
drops dead one day.  His lawyer informs his widow that Stu Schwartz, Sam's best
friend since childhood, is to be executor of the will.  The day comes to divide
Sam's earthly possessions, over a million dollars' worth.  In front of Sam's
family, Stu reads the will:
   "Stu, if you're reading this, then I must be dead.  You've were such a good
friend for so long, how can I ignore you in this will?  On the other hand, there
are my beloved Sophie and my children to be looked after.  Stu, I know you can
make sure my family is taken care of properly.  So Stu, give what you want to
her and take the rest for yourself."  Stu then looks at the survivors and tells
them that, in accordance with Sam's instructions, Stu will give fifty thousand
dollars to Sam's widow.  The rest he is retaining for himself.
   The family is beside itself.  "This is impossible!  Forty years of marriage
and then *this*?!  It can't be!"  So the family sues.  Their day in court
arrives, and after testimony from both sides, the judge gives his verdict:  "To
Stuart Schwartz, I award fifty thousand dollars of the contested money.  The
remainder shall go to Sophie Cohen, widow of the deceased."  Needless to say,
the family is elated, but Stu is dumbfound.  "Your honor, how can you do this?
The will made Sam's wishes quite clear:  'Give what you want to her and take the
rest for yourself!'  I wanted the lion's share!  What gives?"
   The judge answered back, "Mr. Schwartz, Sam Cohen knew you his whole life.
He wanted to give you something in gratitude.  He also wanted to see his family
taken care of.  So he drew up his will accordingly.  But you misread his
instructions.  You see, Sam knew just what kind of a person you are, so with his
family's interest in mind, he didn't say, "give what you want to her and keep
the rest for yourself.'  No.  What Sam said was, "Give what YOU want to HER; and
keep the rest for yourself."

   The October 8, 1990 issue of Fortune has picked up on a small story which
appeared in the Los Angeles Times.
   As best as I remember, there was a lawyer who got caught three times in an
alleged speed trap.  He sued the city under RICO (Racketeering Influence and
Corruption) statutes.  Part of the allegation is that the city set the speed
limit without reviewing the traffic patterns every 5 years.
   A judge ruled that the city could be sued under RICO.
   I doubt that this is what they had in mind when Congress passed the RICO
statutes.

   A truck driver used to amuse himself by running over lawyers he would see
walking down the side of the road.  Every time he would see a lawyer walking
along the road, he would swerve to hit him, and there would be a loud "THUMP"
and then he would swerve back on the road.  This pasttime was immensely
enjoyable to the truck driver.
   One day, as the truck driver was driving along, he saw a priest hitchhiking,
so he thought he would do a good turn by offering the priest a lift.  He pulled
the truck over and asked the priest, "Where are you going, Father?"
   "I'm going to the church 5 miles down the road!" replied the priest.
   "No problem, Father!  I'll give you a lift.  Climb in the truck."
   With that, the happy priest climbed into the passenger seat, and the truck
driver continued down the road.
   Suddenly, the truck driver saw a lawyer walking down the road, and
instinctively he swerved to hit him.  But then he remembered there was a priest
in the truck with him, so at the last minute he swerved back to the road,
narrowly missing the lawyer.  However, even though he was certain he missed the
lawyer, he still heard a loud "THUD".
   Not understanding where the noise came from he glanced in his mirrors, and
when he didn't see anything, he turned to the priest and said, "I'm sorry,
Father.  I almost hit that lawyer."
   "That's okay," replied the priest. "I got him with the door!"

   About 1900, a very respectable Western lawyer was filing some insurance
papers when he came to the question: "If your father is dead, state the cause."
Unwilling to reveal that his father had been hanged for cattle rustling, the
lawyer evaded the problem by answering this way: "He died while taking part in a
public ceremony when the platform gave way."
   After successfully passing the bar exam, a man opened his own law office.  He
was sitting idle at his desk when his secretary announced that a Mr. Jones had
arrived to see him.
   "Show him right in!" our lawyer replied.
   As Mr. Jones was being ushered in, our lawyer had an idea.  He quickly picks
up the phone and shouts into it "And you tell them that we won't accept less
then fifty thousand dollars, and don't even call me until you agree to that
amount!"
   Slamming the phone down he stood up and greeted Mr. Jones; "Good Morning, Mr.
Jones, what can I do for you?"
   "I'm from the phone company" Mr. Jones replied, "I'm here to connect your
phone."

   Experts are people who know a great deal about very little and who go along
learning more and more about less and less until they know practically
everything about nothing.
   Lawyers, on the other hand, are people who know very little about many things
and keep learning less and less about more and more until they know practically
nothing about everything.
   Judges are people who start out knowing everything about everything but end
up knowing nothing about anything because of their constant association with
experts and lawyers.

   A very good man dies, and as a reward for a life well-spent, goes to heaven.
When he arrives, St. Peter meets him at the gate.
   "Welcome," says St. Peter, "since you were such a good person in life, you
may enter heaven."
   "Thank you," said the man.  "But before I come in, could you tell me what

   A mature woman was in the pastorial study counseling for her upcoming fourth
wedding.
   "Father, how am I going to tell my husband that I am still a virgin?"
   "My child, you have been a married woman for many years.  Surely that cannot
be."
   "Well, father, my first husband was a psychologist, and all he wanted to do
was talk, and the next one was in construction and he always said he'd get to it
tomorrow.  The last one was a gynecologist and all he did was look.  But this
time, father, I'm marrying a lawyer and I'm sure I'm going to get screwed."

   It seems that a devout, good couple was about to get married, but a tragic
car accident ended their lives.
   When they got to heaven, they asked St. Peter if he could arrange for them to
be married, saying that it was what they had hoped for in life, and they still
desired wedded union.  He thought about it and agreed, but said they would have
to wait.
   It was almost one hundred years later when St. Peter sent for them.  They
were married in a simple ceremony.
   So things went on, for thirty years or so, but they determined, in this time,
that eternity was best not spent together.
   They went back to St. Peter, and said, "We thought we would be happy forever,
but now we believe that we have irreconcilable differences.  Is there any way we
can get divorced?"
   "Are you kidding?" said St. Peter.  "It took me a hundred years to get a
priest up here to marry you.  I'll never get a lawyer!"

   A doctor, a lawyer and a mathematician were discussing the relative merits of
having a wife or a mistress.
   The lawyer says: "For sure a mistress is better.  If you have a wife and want
a divorce, it causes all sorts of legal problems.
   The doctor says: "It's better to have a wife because the sense of security
lowers your stress and is good for your health.
   The mathematician says: "You're both wrong.  It's best to have both so that
when the wife thinks you're with the mistress and the mistress thinks you're
with your wife, you can do some mathematics.
