                       Knowing he was near death a rich guy called three of his
                       best friends to ask their help. He had a plan on how to take
                       some of his money with him after his dealth. The three
                       friends were a priest, a doctor and a lawyer. The guy gave
                       each of them $50,000 in cash and told them to put the money
                       in an envelope and after his death they were to put the
                       money in his casket when viewing the body. After the guy
                       was buried the three friends got together. The priest told the
                       others that he only put $20,000 in the casket and used the
                       other $30,000 to help the poor. The doctor said he only put in
                       $30,000 and used the remainder to fund a health care facility
                       for the homeless. The lawyer told them he was ashamed of
                       what they had done. He told them that he had given his
                       dearly departed rich friend the full amount- a $50,000 check.
