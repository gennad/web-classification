                       An engineer dies and is before St. Peter. St. Peter says "we
                       don't have you on the list to go to heaven, but your file says
                       you shouldn't be damned either. Tell you what, we'll send
                       you down to hell for a couple of days while we sort this out."
                       The engineer reluctantly goes to hell. The first thing Satan
                       says to him is "we don't have you on our list either, so you
                       can wait in the processing room." Well, the engineer notices
                       there are several problems with the heat, smoke, and water
                       system and immediately designs an air condition system,
                       waste disposal, and air purification. He then rewires the place
                       for piped in music. Satan is please with the improvements.
                       St. Peter calls down and says "hey, you've got an engineer
                       down here that belongs with us." Satan replies, "No way.
                       He's done a great job down here and we're keeping him."
                       St.Peter says "If you don't give him back, we'll sue." Satan
                       replies "Fine...just where do you thing you'll find a lawyer?"
