A man walked into an antique shop looking for something unusual. In a dusty
corner he found a brass statue of a rat. It was very unusual so he asked the
shopkeeper how much he wanted for it.
"$50 for the statue and $1,000 for the story behind it." "I don't need any
story," the man said as he handed over $50, took the rat, got in his car and
headed for home. He stopped at a stop light and noticed rats were pouring
out of all the buildings and sewer grates around him and were heading for
his car. The light changed and he sped off but when he looked in his rear
view mirror he saw a huge horde of rats racing after him. He drove as fast
as he could to the beach, jumped out of his car and hurled the statue as far
out into the ocean as he could. The horde of rats ran past him and every one
of them leaped into the ocean after the statue and they all drowned. The man
drove back to the antique store and when he walked in the shopkeeper said,
"I knew you'd be back for the story!"
"To hell with the story, I came back to see if you have a statue of a
lawyer!"
