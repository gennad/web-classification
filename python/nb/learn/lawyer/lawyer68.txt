The old man was critically ill. Feeling that death was near, he called his
lawyer. "I want to become a lawyer. How much is it for that express degree
you told me about?" "It's $50,000", the lawyer said, "But why? You'll be
dead soon, why do you want to become a lawyer?" "That's my business! Get me
the course!" Four days later, the old man got his law degree. His lawyer was
at his bedside making sure his bill would be paid. Suddenly the old man was
racked with fits of coughing, and it was clear that this would be the end.
Still curious, the lawyer leaned over and said, "Please, before it's too
late, tell me why you wanted to get a law degree so badly before you died?"
In a faint whisper, as he breathed his last, the old man said: "One less
lawyer".
