   A Rabbi, a Hindu and a lawyer were driving late at night in the country when
their car expired.  They set out to find help, and came to a farmhouse.  When
they knocked at the door, the farmer explained that he had only two beds, and
one of the three had to sleep in the barn with the animals.  The three quickly
agreed.
   The Rabbi said he would sleep in the barn and let the other two have the
beds.  Ten minutes after the Rabbi left, there was a knock on the bedroom door.
The Rabbi entered exclaiming "I can't sleep in the barn; there is a pig in
there.  It's against my religion to sleep in the same room with a pig!"
   The Hindu said he would sleep in the barn, as he had no religious problem
with pigs.  However, about five minutes later, the Hindu burst through the
bedroom door saying "There's a cow in the barn!  I can't sleep in the same room
as a cow!  It's against my religion!"
   The lawyer, anxious to get to sleep, said he'd go to the barn, as he had no
problem sleeping with animals.
   In two minutes, the bedroom door burst open and the pig and the cow
entered...
