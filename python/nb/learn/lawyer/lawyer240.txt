A lawyer died and arrived at the pearly gates.  To his dismay, there were
thousands of people ahead of him in line to see St. Peter.  To his surprise, St.
Peter left his desk at the gate and came down the long line to where the lawyer
was, and greeted him warmly.  Then St. Peter and one of his assistants took the
lawyer by the hands and guided him up to the front of the line, and into a
comfortable chair by his desk.  The lawyer said, "I don't mind all this
attention, but what makes me so special?"  St. Peter replied, "Well, I've added
up all the hours for which you billed your clients, and by my calculation you
must be about 193 years old!"
