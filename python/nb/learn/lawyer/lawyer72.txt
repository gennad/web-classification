A lawyer had a jury trial in a very difficult business case. The client who
had attended the trial was out of town when the jury came back with its
decision, which was for the lawyer and his client. The lawyer immediately
sent a telegram to his client, reading "Justice has triumphed!" The client
wired back, "Appeal at once!"
