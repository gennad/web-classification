A judge in a semi-small city was hearing a drunk-driving case and the defendant,
who had both a record and a reputation for driving under the influence, demanded
a jury trial.  It was nearly 4 P. M.  And getting a jury would take time, so the
judge called a recess and went out in the hall looking to impanel anyone
available for jury duty.  He found a dozen lawyers in the main lobby and told
them that they were a jury.  The lawyers thought this would be a novel
experience and so followed the judge back to the courtroom.  The trial was over
in about 10 minutes and it was very clear that the defendant was guilty.  The
jury went into the jury-room, the judge started getting ready to go home, and
everyone waited.  After nearly three hours, the judge was totally out of
patience and sent the bailiff into the jury-room to see what was holding up the
verdict.  When the bailiff returned, the judge said, "Well have they got a
verdict yet?"  The bailiff shook his head and said, "Verdict?  Hell, they're
still doing nominating speeches for the foreman's position!"
