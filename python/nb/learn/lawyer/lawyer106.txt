                       A bus load of Lawyers is traveling down a deserted road.
                       Suddenly it swerves into a field and hits a tree, and catches
                       fire. The owner of the field, a farmer, run up, surveys the
                       scence, and buries all the lawyers. A week later, two
                       policemen are traveling down that same road and notice the
                       wreckage. The run up to the house and asks what happened.
                       "A busload of lawery crashed into the tree and the bus
                       caught fire" replied the farmer. "but what happened to all the
                       lawerys?!' asked the policeman. "I buried them." The farmer
                       said. "They were all dead?" cried the officer. "some of them
                       said they weren't," replied the farmer, "but you know that
                       lawyers are very good at lying."
