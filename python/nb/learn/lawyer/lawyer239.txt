A grade school teacher was asking students what their parents did for a living.
"Tim, you be first," she said.  "What does your mother do all day?"  Tim stood
up and proudly said, "She's a doctor."  "That's wonderful. How about you, Amie?"
Amie shyly stood up, scuffed her feet and said, "My father is a mailman." "Thank
you, Amie," said the teacher.  "What about your father, Billy?"  Billy proudly
stood up and announced, "My daddy plays piano in a whorehouse."  The teacher was
aghast and promptly changed the subject to geography.  Later that day she went
to Billy's house and rang the bell.  Billy's father answered the door.  The
teacher explained what his son had said and demanded an explanation.  Billy's
father said, "I'm actually an attorney.  How can I explain a thing like that to
a seven-year-old?"
