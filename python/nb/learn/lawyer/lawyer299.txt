   In the middle of the night, in the middle of nowhere, two cars both slightly
cross over the white line in the center of the road.  They collide and a fair
amount of damage is done, although neither is hurt.  It is impossible to assess
blame for the accident on either however.
   They both get out.  One is a doctor and the other is a lawyer.  The lawyer
calls the police on his car phone; they'll be there in 20 minutes.
   It's cold and damp, and both men are shaken up.  The laywer offers the doctor
a drink of brandy from his hip flask, the doctor accepts, drinks and hands it
back to the lawyer, who puts it away.
   "Aren't you also going to have a drink?" the doctor says.
   "AFTER the police get here." replies the lawyer.
