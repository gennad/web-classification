A lawyer was trying to console a weeping widow.  Her husband had passed away
without a will.  "Did the deceased have any last words?" asked the lawyer. "You
mean *right* before he died?" sobbed the widow.  "Yes," replied the lawyer.
"They might be helpful if it's not too painful for you to recall."  "Well," she
began, "he said "Don't try to scare me!  You couldn't hit the broad side of a
barn with that gun."
