A woman and her little girl were visiting the grave of the little girl's
grandmother.  On their way through the cemetery back to the car, the little girl
asked, "Mommy, do they ever bury two people in the same grave?"  "Of course not,
dear." replied the mother, "Why would you think that?" "The tombstone back there
said 'Here lies a lawyer and an honest man.'"
