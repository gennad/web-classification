                       One day a man was digging a hole to plant a tree in his back
                       yard. After digging about 2 feet he hit a lamp, so he picked it
                       up and brushed it off. Suddenly out popped a Genie who said
                       he would grant him three wishes. "Great!" the man
                       explained. "However," said the genie,"i must know who you
                       hate the most." "I hate that lawyer down the street the
                       most." the man said. "Well," said the genie, "whatever you
                       wish for, the lawyer gets double that." Eager to get his
                       wishing started, the man exclaimed "I wish i had a million
                       dollars!." Poof! there was a million dollars next to him "Now
                       remember the lawyer has 2 million dollars," said the genie.
                       Once again the man blurted out a wish impatiently. "I wish i
                       had a lemo and a driver!" Poof! Suddenly there was a lemo
                       and a driver in his driveway. "Remember, the lawyer has 2
                       lemo's and 2 drivers." the genie said. "This is your final wish,
                       make it a good one." After a long period of thought, the man
                       grabbed his shovel and handed it to the genie. Then he
                       exclaimed, "I wish you would beat me HALF to DEATH.
