A lawyer's dog, running about unleashed, beelines for a butcher shop and steals
a roast.  Butcher goes to lawyer's office and asks, "if a dog running unleashed
steals a piece of meat from my store, do I have a right to demand payment for
the meat from the dog's owner?"  The lawyer answers, "Absolutely." "Then you owe
me $8.  50.  Your dog was loose and stole a roast from me today." The lawyer,
without a word, writes the butcher a check for $8.  50 [attorneys don't carry
cash - it's too plebeian - and the butcher hadn't brought the shop's credit card
imprinter to the lawyer's office].  Several periods of time later - it could be
the next day but that would be unrealistic - the butcher opens the mail and
finds an envelope from the lawyer: $20 due for a consultation.
