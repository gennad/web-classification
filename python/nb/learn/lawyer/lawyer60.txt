The devil visited a lawyer's office and made him an offer. "I can arrange
some things for you, " the devil said. "I'll increase your income five-fold.
Your partners will love you; your clients will respect you; you'll have four
months of vacation each year and live to be a hundred. All I require in
return is that your wife's soul, your children's souls, and their children's
souls rot in hell for eternity."
The lawyer thought for a moment. "What's the catch?", he asked.
