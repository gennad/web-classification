Three surgeons were talking together. The first one said: "For my money, the
best of all possible patients are German people. All of their parts are
numbered, so it's easy to take them apart and put them back together. "The
second surgeon pipes up: "No, the best patients for surgery are Japanese
people. All of their parts are color-coded."
