   A man went to a brain store to get some brain for dinner.  He sees a sign
remarking on the quality of professional brain offered at this particular brain
store.  So he asks the butcher: "How much for Engineer brain?"
   "3 dollars an ounce."
   "How much for <other generic profession> brain?"
   "4 dollars an ounce."
   "How much for lawyer brain?"
   "100 dollars an ounce."
   "Why is lawyer brain so much more?"
   "Do you know how many lawyers you need to kill to get one ounce of brain?"
