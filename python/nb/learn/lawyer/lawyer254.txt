Lawyers in Japan

Copied from the Sunday Daily Breeze -

Take heart, America.  Three monkey wrenches have been thrown into Japan's
well-oiled economic machine.  It's only a mater of time before that powerful
engine of productivity begins to sputter and fail.

What could cause such a sharp turnaround?  High interest rates?  Increased
unemployment?  Lower productivity?  No, it's something much more economically
debilitating - and permanent.

Three American lawyers have become the first foreign attorneys permitted to
practice law in Japan.  What's more, two of them are from New York!

The decline has begun.

Japan has one attorney for every 10,000 residents, compared to the U.S. ratio of
one attorney for every 390 residents.  For every 100 attorneys trained in Japan,
there are 1,000 engineers.  In the United States, that ratio is reversed.

But a law that became effective on April 1 permits foreigners to practice in
Japan for the first time since 1955.  Already, an additional 20 American and six
British lawyers have applied for permission to open practices in Japan.

If anything can slow the Japanese economy, it's the presence of American
attorneys.  What better way to even our balance of trade than to send Japan our
costliest surplus commodity?
