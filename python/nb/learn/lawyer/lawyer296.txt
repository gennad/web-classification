A lawyer is driving his new, red, convertible BMW when he runs a red light and
is broad-sided by a Ford.  He stumbles out in shock, all the while whining "My
Beemer.  My poor Beemer".  A cop arrives on the scene and points out "Sir, your
arm has been torn off".  The lawyer looks at where his left arm used to be and
screams "MY ROLEX!"
