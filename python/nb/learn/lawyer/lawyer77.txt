A 70 year old man was in the hospital awaiting news about the availability
of a heart for his transplant, when he was offered the heart of a 28 year
old marathon runner who just died in an accident. He turned that heart down.
The next day, he was offered a heart from a 35 year old construction worker,
who fell to his death. He did not accept that heart either. Several days
later he agreed to take the heart of a 50 year old lawyer. After the man
awoke from the surgery, they asked him why he turned down two perfectly good
hearts to select the one he did. His reply was, "I wanted one that had never
been used."
