   Three women always hang their laundry out in the backyard.  When it rains,
however, the laundry always get wet.  All the laundry, that is, except for
Sophie's.  The other two women wonder why Sophie never has her laundry out on
the days that it rains.
   So one day, they are all out in the backyard putting their clothes on the
line when one of the women says to Sophie, "Say, how come when it rains, your
laundry is never out?"
   "Well," says Sophie, "when I wake up in the morning, I look over at Saul. If
his penis is hanging over his *right* leg, I know it's going to be a great day,
and I can hang out the wash.  If his penis is hanging over his *left* leg, I
know it's going to rain, so I don't hang out the wash."
   "What if he has an erection?" asks one of the women.
   "Honey," says Sophie, "on a day like *that*, you don't do the *laundry*."
