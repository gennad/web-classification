   The day befor Thanksgiving this little boy heard his mom and dad fighting.
   The husband said to his wife, "You stupid bitch, you have floppy tits."
   She wasn't about to be outdone and said, "Well you have a crooked dick, you
bastard."
   Well, the little boy heard every word they said.  After they got done
fighting, he went up to the mom and asked her what bitches and bastards were. 
She told him that they were people.  Then he asked what crooked dicks and floppy
tits were.  She told him that they were coats and hats.  The little boy accepted
both answers and went on his way.
   The next day, they were getting ready for a huge feast with friends and
family.  The little boy went up stairs where his dad was shaving.  The dad cut
himself and said "Shit!"  Well once again, the boy started asking questions and
asked what 'shit' was.  The father told him that it was "shaving cream".  The
boy accepted this answer and went downstairs were his mom was stuffing a turkey.
When the mom cut herself with a knife, she said "Fuck!"  The boy once again
asked what 'fuck' was.  She told him that it was "stuffing".  About that time,
the door bell rang.
   When the little boy went to answer the door, it was his grandparents.  Upon
opening the door, the little boy said: "Hi bitches and bastards.  Let me take
your crooked dicks and floppy tits for you.  Dad's upstairs putting shit on his
face and mom's in the kitchen fucking the turkey."
