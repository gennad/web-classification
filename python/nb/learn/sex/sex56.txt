Some smart looking businessman dude was sitting in a bar drinking a beer one
night when a gorgeous well stacked blonde walked in.  She says "For $250, I'll
do anything you want, only you have to describe it in three words or less".  He
thinks about this a minute or so, pulls out $250, and says "Paint my house".
