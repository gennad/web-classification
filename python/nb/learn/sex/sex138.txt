A woman gets up, puts up the shade, takes the cover off the parrot's cage, makes
coffee, and has a cigarette.  Suddenly the phone rings.  Her boyfriend is coming
over.  She puts out the cigarette, pulls down the shade, puts the cover back on
the parrot's cage, and gets back into bed.  The parrot, from under the cloth:
"Well that was a short fuckin' day!"
