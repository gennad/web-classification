   Three male friends were in a bar one evening bragging about exploits and
abilities.  The conversation finally turned to a comparison of genital
endowment.  To prove their cases the three men placed said topics of
conversation on the bar for measurement.
   Just then, another male patron, who preferred sexual partners of the same
gender, entered the bar and noticed the competition.  The bartender asked the
man, "What'll ya have?"
   The man replies, "Well, I was going to have a beer but I think I'll have
the buffet instead."
