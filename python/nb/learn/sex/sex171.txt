IUD (Insidious Undermining of Discussion) methods come into play when, despite
all endeavours described above, a rival idea has taken root.  The best option in
this case is to cause so much confusion that the idea is swamped and forgotten.
The techniques of Sterilization (section 3.1) are relevant here although in a
different context, but some specialized IUD tactics are:

- querying definitions and terminology with a view to ensuring that everyone
doubts that he understands what anyone is talking about

- quibbling over editorial niceties and getting the original ideas lost in a
discussion of their form not their content.
