A man is walking past this house when a used condom comes flying out of the
second story window and lands squarely on his head.  Rather disgusted and
absolutely furious, he goes up to the front door and starts pounding on it.  An
elderly man opens it and asks him what caused him to knock so loudly.  The
passerby asks, "Who's in your upstairs room?"  The elderly man replies, "I can't
see how it's any of your business.  Since, you must know, my daughter and
intended son-in-law are upstairs."  The passerby hands him the used condom and
says, "Well, I just wanted you to know that your intended grandchild fell out
the window!"
