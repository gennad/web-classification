   For their golden anniversary, a couple decides to repeat their honeymoon
trip.  They drive to the Poconos and find the same romantic lodge is still
there.  A vibrant young couple, clearly very much in love, is checking in when
they arrive.  The husband says "I'll just nip around by their window and see
what they do - we can maybe get some ideas to spice up our 50th year!"
   Sure enough, through a crack in the curtains he sees the young couple engaged
in foreplay.  They are naked, sitting on the floor some distance apart with
their legs spread.  The young man is shooting marbles, aiming to lodge them
between her vertical lips; she is tossing doughnuts, aiming to ring them around
his erect member.  After a few minutes of this they rush together and make
tumultuous love.
   The old man is quite excited by this idea, and makes his way back to his
eagerly waiting wife.  He describes the game, his wife getting more and more
inflamed herself.  "Darling, this is going to be so good," she says: "Run right
out for some grapefruit and lifesavers!"
