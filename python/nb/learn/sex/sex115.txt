   There are three people in a pub.  Two of them are talking to each other.
They seem to be brooding.  So they ask each other why they are brooding.
   The first one says : "Well, I think it's because I have sex only once every
month."
   Then the second one replies : "Oh, that's true".  In my case, it's only once
every other month".
   Then, they both look at the third guy, who seems to be very cheerful.  They
are puzzled, so they ask him how often he has a screw.
   "Once every six monthes" says the fellow.
   "Then", ask the first, "why are you so happy?"
   And the third replies "Because it's tonight !!!"
