   A fellow picked up a girl in a bar and took her home with him.  After some
preliminary drinks and talk, they got undressed, climbed into bed and generally
got organized for a leg over.  After a few minutes, the girl started laughing.
The fellow asked her what she found so amusing.  "Your organ," she replied.
"It's a bit on the small side."  Hurt, he replied: "It's not used to playing in
cathedrals."
