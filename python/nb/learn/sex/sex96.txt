It seems that mathematics isn't so impeccable after all!  Especially when it
comes to sex!  Here are some mathematical truisms that didn't quite hold up!

If you are having sex with TWO women and ONE more woman walks in, what do you
   have?
Divorce proceedings, most likely.

If you have two friends and six women, how many women do each of your friends
   get?
None.

Is three an odd number?
Not in this day and age.

If a 6-inch penis can attract 10 women, how many women can an 18-inch penis
   attract?
Two billion.

If you go to bed 9 hours before you have to wake up, and you wife wants to have
   2 hours of sex, how much sleep will you get?
8 hours, 59 minutes - who cares what she wants!

How are math and sex the same?
I don't get either one.
