   Two storks on a nest: a father stork and baby stork.  Baby is crying and
crying, and father stork is trying to calm him.
   "Don't worry, son. Your mother will come back.  She's only bringing people
babies and making them happy."
   The next night, it's fathers turn to do the job. "Son, your father will be
back as soon as possible, but now he's bringing joy to new mommies and daddies."
   A few days later.  The stork parents are desperate: their son is gone from
the nest all night!  Finally, short before dawn, he returns and the parents ask
their son where he had been all night.
   Says the baby stork: "Aww, just scaring the shit out of college kids!"
