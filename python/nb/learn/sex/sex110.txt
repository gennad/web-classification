Entry in young woman's diary :

   Monday : Went out with John tonight.  We were in his car and he tried to get
too friendly. I got out of the car and walked away.  My legs are still my best
friends.
   Tuesday : Went out with Peter tonight.  We were in his car and he tried to
get too friendly also.  I got out of the car and walked away.  My legs are still
my best friends.
   Wednesday : Went out with Jock tonight.  I like Jock.  We were in his car and
he tried to get too friendly.  I didn't get out and walk away.  Even the best of
friends must part!
