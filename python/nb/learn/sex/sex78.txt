   A poor man told his wife,  I am sick and tired of being poor, I am going to
work overseas.  So, he took off to Africa.  A few years later, he returned.   As
he approached his house he got stunned with the luxurious and rich look of the
house.  He knocked on the door, the servant opened.
   "Is the housewife in?" he asked.
    The servant replied: "Just a moment."  The wife comes out:
   Wife: Wow, my man, all dressed up as a rich man after these years.
   Husband: Guess what?  I am rich.
   Wife:  How?
   Husband: I went to Africa, found people walk with no underwear and sleep on
sand, so I began to make and sell underwear and beds.  Due to the high demand,
I got rich fast.
   Wife: A man, with all of your strength, had to go all the way to Africa,
making beds and underwear, to get rich, and I am a little woman that stayed
here, without underwear and on a single bed...I got REAL rich.
