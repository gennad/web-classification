As a fall-back position it is possible to use the CAP (Competitor Annihalation
Programme), although it must be applied only after the situation has been
carefully sized up. The intention is to ensure that competitive ideas, although
properly presented, fall on deaf ears. To arrange this takes real skill, but
some ploys are:

- lobbying people before the meeting to make sure that their minds are already
made up

- diminishing the status of contributions by contriving that they are given as
individual rather than organization positions

- arranging for rival contributions to be made just after lunch or as late as
possible (once again, being Chairman helps!)
