   A man and his girl friend wanted to engage in passionate sex for the first
time.  He pulled off his socks.
   "What happened to your toes?" she asked.
   "Tolio" he said, as he pulled off his pants.
   "What happened to your knees?"
   "Kneesles" he said.
   He took off his underwear.
   She said: "Don't tell me, smallpox, right?"
