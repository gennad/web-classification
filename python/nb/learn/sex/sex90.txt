   A bartender has a problem with a regular customer who nightly proclaims that
he's the baddest ass person around.  Eventually tiring of this boasting, the
bartender says "If you're such a bad ass, then you'll have to prove it to me."
   The customer says "No problem, name it."
   The bartender says" Okay, there's three things you have to do: first, there's
this big bully at the end of the bar who's been hassling my customers all night;
you have to kick him out of the bar.  Secondly, I have an alligator in the back
room that has had an abcessed tooth for the past week, you have to pull it.
Third, there's a hooker up stairs who's never been satisfied, you have to go up
there and make her come.
   The customer replies, "No problem" and commences to kick the bully out of the
bar.  After that he says "OK, show me to the alligator."  The bartender takes
the man to the back room and shuts the door.
   For about an hour there's a tremendous ruckus going on in the back room.  The
man eventually emerges with his clothes all torn and his body scratched and
bitten, he goes up to the bartender and says "OK, where's the hooker with the
abcessed tooth?"
