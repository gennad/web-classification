   Mrs. Jones goes to see her obstetrician, Dr. Smith. She says, "Dr. Smith, I'm
pregnant again.  I need a hearing aid."
   Dr. Smith says, "Mrs. Jones, I thought we decided last time that your twelve
children were more than you could handle, and that you should not get pregnant
again.  I'm going to give you a powerful contraceptive."
   Mrs. Jones replies, "But, doctor, I don't need a contraceptive.  I need a
hearing aid."
   Dr. Smith: "How come, Mrs. Jones?"
   Mrs. Jones: "Well, you see, doctor, I'm kinda hard of hearing.  At night,
when the mister and I turn off the lights and go to bed, he asks me, 'Do you
want to go to sleep, or what?' And, I always say, 'What?'"
