   A young boy asks his Grandmother how old she is, to which she replies "That's
none of your business."
   So he asks her how much she weighs and again she replies "thats none of your
business."
   So he asks her why she and Grandpa sleep in separate bedrooms.  Grandma gets
angry at this point and sends him off to play.
   The boy goes straight to his Grandpa and explains what happened and his
grandpa tells him that Grandmothers are like that, but if he really wants to
know to, sneak a peak at her drivers license in her purse.
   Later, the little boy approaches Grandma and says "I know that you are 64
years old, weigh 147 pounds, and that the reason you don't sleep with Grandpa is
because you got an "F" in 'Sex'!!!
