   Mother is in the kitchen making supper for her family when her youngest
daughter walks in.
   Child: Mother, where do babies come from?
   Mom:  Well dear...a mommy and daddy fall in love and get married.  One night,
they go into they're room...they kiss and hug and have sex.  (The daughter looks
puzzled.)  That means the daddy puts his penis in the mommy's vagina.  That's
how you get a baby, honey.
   Child:  Oh I see, but the other night when I came into you and daddy's room
you had daddy's penis in your mouth.  What do you get when you do that?
   Mom:  Jewelry, dear.
