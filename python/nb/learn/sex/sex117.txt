   Victor, after a long, hard days work, decides he needs some relaxation, so he
goes to his local brothel.  He enters and finds the madam.  As it's the busiest
time of the day, there is only one girl left, who is Chinese and doesn't know a
word of English.
   "I'll take her," he says desperately, as he is also in a hurry.
   So they proceed upstairs and get down to business.  As Victor is going full
whack, the girl begins to shout out "Sung wa! Sung wa!"  To which Victor assumes
that this means great, fantastic, etc, so he continues unperturbed.
   The following day he as at a golf meeting with a wealthy, prospective Chinese
client, and is trying to impress him in any way he can.  Just then, the client
T's off and gets a whole in one.  This gives Victor the opportunity to use his
newly found Chinese phrase... "Sung wa! Sung wa!" he proclaims, to which the
client replies, "Wrong hole?  What do you mean wrong hole?"
