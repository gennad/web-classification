A man went into the bar.  He said to the barman, "I want to celebrate my first
blow job, so give me a double whiskey."  So he drank it straight down.  He then
ordered 2 more, then another 2 and then another 2 again...  The barman asked,
"you sure you've had enough?"  The man replied, "just enough to take the taste
away."
