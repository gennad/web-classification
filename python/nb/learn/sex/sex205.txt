Bumbling Trivia

   In proportion to its body size, the genitalia of a drone bee are among the
largest of any animal on earth.  Mention this to the girls over bridge and
you'll definitely get the conversation off Tupperware.
   The size of its equipment is thought to be directly related to the drone's
post-coital fate, namely death.  The genitals are contained in the abdomen and
presumably getting them out of the abdomen for the purpose of mating places such
strain on the bee that it dies in the process.  The proximate cause of the
drone's demise is that its privates are (urk) ripped off during the act.  One
more reason for caution, boys, when we are fumbling around in the dark.
   One last thing.  Despite its status as bee stud, the drone is not itself
produced as a result of sex.  On the contrary, it develops from an unfertilized
egg.  (Fertilized eggs become either workers or queens.)  Thus the queen bee is
capable of parthenogenesis and drone bees have no father, only a grandfather. 
You think your family is dysfunctional; be glad you're not a bee.
