   A man and a woman are getting it on in bed when they hear the front door
open.  The woman says, "It's my husband!  You'd better hide."
   She throws his clothes under the bed and he hides behind the curtains.  Her
husband comes in, sees her all hot and sweaty, and the sheets all messed up.  He
looks around, and sees a big bulge in the curtains, and a pair of feet sticking
out underneath.  He whips the curtains open, and says, "Who the hell are you?"
   The man says, "I'm the moth inspector."
   The husband says, "Moth inspector?  Why are you naked?"
   The man looks down and says, "Damn.  I'm too late."
