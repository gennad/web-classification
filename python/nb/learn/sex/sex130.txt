   A woman is nearly caught with her lover when her husband comes home early.
To hide her lover, she puts him in the closet.  While in the closet, the lover
soon learns that he is not alone.  The breathing he hears belongs to, he
discovers, the woman's young son.
   "Gee, it's dark in here, sir," said the boy.
   "Geez, kid, please shut up," replied the nervous man.
   "Well, mister, I think I'm gonna scream."
   "Please, kid, don't scream."
   "Can I have some money?" asked the boy.
   "Well, here, here's five dollars, it's all I've got."
   The boy, sensing that the man was lying, pressed on.
   "I really feel like screaming."
   "No, kid, look, here's fifty dollars, just don't scream."
   "Well, I don't know"
   "Here's the last of my money, just don't scream."
   The boy, satisfied, agreed to be quiet.  Later, he went with his mother to a
store where a brand new bike was on sale.  When he tried to buy it with his
new-found cash, his mother became suspicious of the source of this money.
   So, being a "good" Christian, she took him in to see the local pastor in
confession.
   "Gee," said the boy, not used to being in the confessional, "it sure is dark
in here."
   "Don't start that with me again," said the priest.
