   Little Red Riding Hood is riding through the woods to see her grandmother. As
she enters the woods a birds lands on her shoulder and exclaims "Little Red
Riding Hood, Little Red Riding Hood, please don't go any further.  The big bad
wolf says he's going to get you and fondle you.  Little Red Riding Hood
disregards the bird's warning and proceeds even further into the woods.  A
little bit later, a squirrel catches her attention and cries "Little Red Riding
Hood, please don't go any further!  The big bad wolf is going to get you and
fondle you!"  Little Red Riding Hood responds with mocking laughter and
continues on into the woods.  Some time later, a fox comes bounding out of the
woods hollering for Little Red Riding Hood to turn back.  "Little Red Riding
Hood, Little Red Riding Hood, please please don't go any further.  The big bad
wolf is just up ahead.  He's going to get you and fondle you!"  Little Red
Riding Hood blows him off as she did the others and rides on.  A few moments
later, the big bad wolf makes his promised appearance.  He leaps out of the
woods growling menacingly "Little Red Riding Hood, Little Red Riding Hood, I'm
going to get you and fondle you!"  Little Red Riding Hood nonchalantly reaches
into her knapsack, pulls out a pistol, looks the wolf squarely in the eyes and
says "no you're not, you are going to eat me like the story says."
