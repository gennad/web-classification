Max and Ernie are playing racquetball at the local gym.  As they are changing
clothes in the locker room Max takes off his T-shirt and shorts.  He is wearing
a bra and a lace garter belt.  "My God," says Ernie, "when did you start wearing
women's underwear?"  "Ever since my wife found them in my glove compartment."
