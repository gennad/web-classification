   One man's hobby was fishing, he spent all his weekends near the river or
lake, paying no attention to weather.
   One Sunday, early in the morning, he went to the river, as usual.  It was
cold and raining, and he decided to return back to his house.  He came in, went
to his bedroom, undressed and layed near his wife.
   "What a terrible weather today, honey." he said to her.
   "Yes. And my idiot went fishing!"
