List Of Possible Slogans Promoting 'National Condom Week'

A crank with armor will never harm her
Before getting drastic, wrap it in plastic
Before getting laid, wrap up your spade
Before you attack her, wrap your whacker
Bodies shouldn't go slapping unless peter's got his wrapping
Cover your stump before you hump
Don't be a fool, vulcanize your tool
Don't be a loner, cover your boner
Don't make a mistake, cover your snake.
Don't be silly, protect your willy
Especially in December, gift wrap your member
If you can't shield your rocket, leave it in your pocket.
If you go into heat, package your meat
If you really love her, wear a cover.
If you slip between her thighs, be sure to condomize
If you think she's spunky, cover your monkey
If you're not going to sack it, go home and whack it
It will be sweeter if you wrap your peter
Never ever deck her with an unwrapped pecker
No glove, no love!
Sex is cleaner with a packaged wiener.
She won't get sick if you wrap your dick
The right selection will protect your erection
When in doubt, shroud your spout
When you take off her pants and blouse, slip up your trouser mouse
While you're undressing venus, dress up your penis
Wrap it in foil before checking her oil
You can't go wrong if you shield your dong
You could get a germ if you don't cover your worm
You might wind up dead if you don't shield your head
