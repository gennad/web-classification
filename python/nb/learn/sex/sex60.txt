   A 70-year-old man has never been married.  One day, he meets a beautiful
17-year-old girl, and it is love at first sight.  They get married and go to
Florida for their honeymoon.  When they get back, his friend says to him, "So,
tell me, how was it?"
   "Oh, it was beautiful," says the man.  "The sun, the surf, we made love
almost every night, we -"
   His friend interrupts him.  "A man your age!  How did you make love almost
every night?"
   "Oh," says the man, "we almost made love Monday, we almost made love
Tuesday..."
