The intention here is to prevent rival organizations from producing any useful
ideas. As a rule this only delays rather than prevents effective output, but
time is of the essence in Standardization work. Sterilization methods require
attendance at rival organization meetings.  Some techniques used are:

- bogging down the meeting by discussing trivia and causing diversions onto
irrelevant topics.

- introducing contributions from other organizations and insisting that they be
evaluated for consistency with the work of the organization itself.

- sending enough people to the meeting to ensure that promising ideas are voted
down.
