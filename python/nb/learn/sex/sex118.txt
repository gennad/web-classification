   A hunter goes into the woods to hunt a bear.  He carries his trusty 22-gauge
rifle with him.  After a while, he spots a very large bear, takes aim, and
fires.  When the smoke clears, the bear is gone.  A moment later the bear taps
the hunter on the shoulder and says, "No one shoots at me and gets away with it.
You have two choices: I can rip your throat out and eat you, or you can drop
your trousers, bend over, and I'll [insert appropriate colloquial for sodomy
here]."  The hunter decides that anything is better than death, so he drops his
trousers and bends over, and the bear does what he said he would do.
   After the bear has left, the hunter pulls up his trousers again and staggers
back into town.  He's pretty mad.  He buys a much larger gun and returns to the
forest.  He sees the same bear, aims, and fires.  When the smoke clears, the
bear is gone.  A moment later the bear taps the hunter on the shoulder and says,
"You know what to do."
   Afterwards, the hunter pulls up his trousers, crawls back into town, and buys
a bazooka.  Now he's really mad.  He returns to the forest, sees the bear, aims,
and fires.  The force of the bazooka blast knocks him flat on his back.  When
the smoke clears, the bear is standing over him and says, "You're not doing this
for the hunting, are you?"
