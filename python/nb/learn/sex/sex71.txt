   Little Johnny, on a day when he was being particularly reckless, was playing
in the backyard one morning.  Soon, some honeybees started swirling around,
annoying little Johnny.  He began stomping on them in his temper.  His father
caught him trampling the honeybees, and after a brief moment of thought said,
"That's it!  No honey for you for one month!"
   Later that afternoon, Johnny pondered upon some butterflies, and soon started
catching them and crushing them under his feet.  His father again caught him,
and after a brief moment of thought, said, "No butter for you for one month!"
   Early that evening, Johnny's mother was cooking dinner, and got jumpy when
cockroaches started scurrying around the kitchen floor.  She began stomping on
them one by one until all the cockroaches were dead.  Johnny's mother looked up
to find Johnny and his father standing there watching her.
   To which Johnny said, "Are you going to tell her, Daddy, or do you want me
to?"
