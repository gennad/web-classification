George Burns is a guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show.

Oprah:  George, you're around 90 years old, and you still have women hanging all
        over you.  What's your secret?

Burns:  Well, Oprah, I'm simply the greatest lover in the world, and once a
        woman finds that out, she refuses to let me go.

Oprah:  Seriously, George... do you spoil them with lavish presents for being
        your sex toys?  I mean, I can't imagine a man of your age being the
        world's greatest lover!

Burns:  I am serious, Oprah... in fact, if you don't believe me, stop by my
        dressing room after the show and I'll show you first hand.

Oprah:  Ok, you're on.

After the show, Oprah stops by George's dressing room and they start to go at
it.  Oprah is having the time of her life, and George is really living up to his
claim.  After about two hours, George stops pumping...

Burns:  Listen, Oprah, I've gotta take a nap for a while, but if you keep both
        of your hands wrapped around my dick, I'll wake up soon and we can go at
        it again.

So she does, and after about a half hour George wakes up and they start going at
it again.  A while later, after Oprah's fourth orgasm, George takes another
breather and again says:

Burns:  Oprah, Oprah, you're holding up great, and I want to keep giving it to
        you, but I've gotta take another nap.  Hold my dick with both your
        hands, and when I wake up, we can go at it again.

Oprah:  Oh, George, you really are the greatest lover in the world, and I can
        understand why a man your age would need to take a break now and then,
        but I don't understand why I need to keep both hands on your dick while
        you're sleeping.

Burns:  That's easy, babe... the last time I had sex with a black girl in my
        dressing room, she stole my wallet while I was asleep.
