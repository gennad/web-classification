Everybody who has a dog calls him "Rover" or "Boy".  I call mine Sex.  Sex has
been embarrassing to me.  When I went to City Hall to renew his license, I told
the clerk I would like to have a license for Sex; he said he would like one too.
Then I said, "But this is a dog."  He said he didn't care what she looked like.
Then I said, "You don't understand.  I have had Sex since I was 9 years old."
He said I must have been quite a kid.  When I got married and went on my
honeymoon, I took the dog with me.  I told the clerk that I wanted a room for my
wife and me, and a special room for Sex.  He said that every room in the place
was for sex.  I said, "You don't understand, Sex keeps me awake at night."  The
clerk said, "Me too."  One day I entered Sex in a contest, but before the
competition began, the dog ran away and a contestant asked me why I was standing
there looking around.  I told him I had planned to have Sex in the contest.  He
told me that I should have sold my own tickets.  "But you don't understand," I
said, "I hoped to have Sex on TV."  He called me a show-off.  When my wife and I
separated, we went to court to fight for custody of the dog.  I said, "Your
Honor, I had Sex before I was married."  The judge said, "Me too."  Then I told
him that after I was separated, Sex left me.  He said "Me too."  Last night, Sex
ran off again.  I spent hours looking around town for him.  A cop came over to
me and asked me, "What are you doing in this alley at 4:00 in the morning."  I
said, "I am looking for Sex."  My case comes up on Friday.
