   Three guys are driving down the road and their car breaks down, so they went
to a farmer's house and asked if they could stay for the night.  The farmer said
okay but someone has to sleep with the chickens, someone has to sleep with the
cows, and someone has to sleep with his 18 daughters.  So one slept with the
chickens, one with the cows, and one with his 18 daughters.
   The next day, one said that he felt like he was a chicken, the other said
that he felt like a cow, and the third said he felt like golf ball.  The farmer
asked why he felt like a golf ball, to which the man replied that if you were in
and out of 18 holes in one night, you would feel like one too.
