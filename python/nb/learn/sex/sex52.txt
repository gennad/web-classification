   These three women were sitting around one night talking about there
boyfriends when they decided they would give their men nicknames based on types
of soda.
   The first woman said: "I'm gonna call Tom "Mountain Dew" because he is as
strong as a mountain and always wants to do it!"
   The second woman said: "I'm gonna call Bruce  "7-Up" because he has seven
inches and it is always up!"
   The third woman said: "I'm gonna call my man "Jack Daniels."
   The other two women responded:  "Jack Daniels?  But that's a hard liquor."
   The third woman replied: "THAT'S MY LEROY!"
