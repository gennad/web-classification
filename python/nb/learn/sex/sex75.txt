   An Italian man was walking along a secluded beach one day, when he spotted a
beautiful naked woman lying on the beach.  Unable to restrain himself, he
immediately jumped on her and proceeded to hump like a rabid rabbit.
   Soon, however, the townspeople came out and began to beat the man, calling
him names. "Bastardo!"  "Perverto!"  They cried out desperately.
   "Perverto? I am-a no perverto!" the man hollered back.
   The people responded, "Idiot! Can't you see this woman is-a dead!?".
   "Dead?!", he cried. "My God, I thought she was-a English!"
