   A little kid goes up to his mother who is lying in the bath naked, and asks
her: "Mummy...whasat??"
   His mother thinks for a little while and then says: "Oh, son...that's my
hedgehog."  And the little boy walks away quite happy with the reply.
   The next week, he walks into the bathroom and sees his wrinkly old grandma
lying naked in the bath.  He asks her what she had between her legs, and again
she tries to explain that it's a hedgehog.
   The little kid then runs screaming to his mother and shouts: "Mummy, Mummy,
Grandma's hedgehog is dead!"
   "Why do you say that son?"
   "Because I could see it's guts hanging out all over the place!"
