The SHEATH (System for Harassment of Enemies and Tying their Hands) is
reasonably reliable if used properly. When attempts to prevent a rival
organization from developing and bringing its own ideas to a meeting have been
unsuccessful, then various methods of frustrating effective delivery of these
ideas are available:

- ensuring that the rival organization does not get a fair hearing (it helps to
be Chairman of the meeting !)

- splitting the meeting into more sub-groups than there are members attending
from the rival organizations so that their contributions are dissipated.
