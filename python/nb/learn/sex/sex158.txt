From The Economist:

   France's greatest lexicographer, Emile Littre', was once found by his wife,
in flagrante, and in the conjugal bedroom at that, with their housemaid. 
   Happily, the exchange that followed makes sense almost as well in English as
in French.
   "Emile," cried Mrs Littre', "I am surprised!"  "No, my dear," replied the
erring lexicographer calmly.  "You are astonished.  It is we who are surprised."
