   A couple went to mass and took confession.  The husband went into the
confessional and said "Forgive me Father, for I have sinned."
   The father asked him the nature of this - to which he replied "While my wife
was bending over the freezer I had lustful thoughts and had my way with her."
   The Priest tried explaining that having sex with your own wife was not a sin
and forgiveness was not needed.  Still, the man insisted that he felt guilty.
The priest told him to say three Hail Mary's and be on his way.
   Next, the wife went into the confessional and said that while she was leaning
over the freezer her husband had had his way with her.  The priest asked her how
long she had been married.  She replied it was three years now.  The priest
tried to explain to her that it was quite proper for married people to have sex
and that there was nothing to be guilty about.  Still, the woman insisted that
she felt guilty so the priest told her to say three Hail Mary's and think no
more about it.
   As she turned to leave, the woman asked the priest if her and her husband
would be banned from the church.  "Banned from the church?!  Whatever gave you
that idea?' the priest queried.  "Well," she said, "they banned us from the
supermarket!"
