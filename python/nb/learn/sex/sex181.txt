   Two elderly ladies are sitting on the porch in their rockers just talking
'girl' talk.
   Emma:  My word Matilda!  You and Johnny were married for quite some time. 
How many years was that anyway?
   Matilda:  Oh, we were married for 65 wonderous years.
   Emma:  My-oh-my-oh-my!  But can you tell me in all that time did you two ever
have mutual orgasm?
   Matilda:  I don't think so.  I believe we had State Farm.
