   A knockout young lady decided she wanted to get rich quick. So, she proceeded
to find herself a rich 73 year old man, planning to screw him to death on their
wedding night.  The courtship and wedding went off without any problem, in spite
of the half-century age difference. On the first night of her honeymoon, she got
undressed, and waited for him to come out of the bathroom to come to bed.  When
he emerged, however, he had nothing on except a rubber to cover a twelve-inch
erection, and was carrying a pair of earplugs and a pair of noseplugs.
   Fearing her plan had gone desperately amiss, she asked "What are those for?"
   The elderly gentleman replied, "There are just two things I can't stand: the
sound of a woman screaming, and the smell of burning rubber."
