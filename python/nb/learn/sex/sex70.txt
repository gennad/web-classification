   Little Johnny was sitting in class one day and the teacher was teaching the
alphabet.  "Okay class, today I'm going to call out a letter.  You have to stand
up when I call on you, recite the letter and a word that begins with the
letter.  Ready?  The first letter is 'A'."
   Little Johnny, of course, instantly raises his hand eagerly.
   The teacher thinks to herself, "I can't call on Johnny.  He'll say 'asshole'
or 'asswipe' or something like that."  So she calls on little Susie. 
   Susie stands up and says, "A.  Apple."
   "Very good Susie!  Okay class, the next letter is 'C'."
   Little Johnny again instantly raises his hand in earnest.
   Again, the teacher thinks to herself, "I can't call Johnny.  He'll say
'cocksucker' or 'cunt' or 'crap' or something like that."  So she calls on
little Bart.
   Bart stands up and says, "C.  Cat."
   "Very good Bart!"
   Now the teacher starts thinking that if she doesn't come up with something
for Johnny to answer with, she'll go bonkers.  Hmmmmm, 'R' doesn't have anything
too nasty?  "Ok class, the next letter is 'R'."
   Little Johnny hesitates and then raises his hand high as he can.
   "Okay Johnny."
   Little Johnny stands up and says, "R.  Rats."
   "Very good Johnny!  Ok..."
   Johnny blurts out, "BIG FUCKING RATS WITH COCKS THIS LONG!!!!"
