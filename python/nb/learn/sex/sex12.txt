The farmboy goes to the big city for a better life.  A hooker picks him up and
they go to a cheap motel for the night.  As they are about to go to bed, she
hands him a condom and asks him to put it on.  He looks very confused, so she
demonstrates on her forefinger.  They are well into their lovemaking when she
suddenly realizes he's not wearing the condom, so she turns on the light and
asks him, "Aren't you wearing the condom, like I showed you?"  He replies, "Sure
am, ma'am", and he shows her his forefinger with the condom on it.
