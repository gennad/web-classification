   Little Johnny was sitting in class one day.  On this particular day, the
teacher wanted to ask her class which part of the body went to heaven first. 
   One little girl raised her hand and said, "I think your mind goes to heaven
first because you have to have a mind in order to believe in God."
   The teacher praises the little girl as a little boy raises his hand.  He
says: "I think your heart goes to heaven first because God is all about love." 
   "Very good," said the teacher.  The teacher looked up and saw Little Johnny's
hand up.  "Oh no," she thought, "I'm not gonna like this.  Little Johnny, which
part of the body do you think goes to heaven first?"
   Little Johnny thinks for a minute and says, "Your feet."  The teacher asked
him why he thought your feet go to heaven first.
   He replied, "Well, I was walking past my parents' bedroom last night and my
mom had her feet up in the air and she said, 'Oh god, I'm coming!'"
