This woman is about to board a bus, but when she steps up, she realizes that her
skirt is too tight, and she can't lift her leg to board.  So, she reaches around
behind her and lowers her zipper a bit and tries again.  Skirt's still too
tight, so she reaches behind her and lowers her zipper some more, and tries
again.  She still can't get on, so she reaches back and lowers the zipper a bit
more.  She tries to step up, and feels two hands on her butt push her up onto
the bus.  She spins around and says, "Sir, I don't know you well enough for you
to do that!"  He says, "Lady, I sure don't know you well enough for you to lower
my zipper three times."
