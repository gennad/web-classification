   This kid walks into the pharmacy: "I've a hot date tonight, a sure thing, and
my buddies said you could fix me up for it."
   "What do you want?"
   "Well, it's a hot date, man.  A sure thing?  You know..."
   "What do you want?"
   "I need some protection, alright??!?!"
   "What size?"
   "Size?  I dunno...  Whatever is considered average I guess."
   "That'll be $2.35 including tax."
   "Tacks?  Tacks?  I thought they stayed on by themselves!"
