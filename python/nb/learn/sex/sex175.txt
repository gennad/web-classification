Ike, Mike and Mustard were on a weekend outing staying at The Olde Log Inn
resort.  Mustard decided to take a nature hike and ended up missing for two
days.  When he turned up in the local infirmary literally beaten to a pulp Ike
and Mike rushed to see what had happened.  According to Mustard, he had gotten
lost.  After wandering around for what seemed like hours he finally spotted a
parked car with what appeared to be people in the back seat.  Unfortunately, the
last thing he remembers was sticking his head through the window and asking "How
far is The Olde Log Inn?"
