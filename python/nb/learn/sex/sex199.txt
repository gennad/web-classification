   A very poor couple had just been married and all they could afford was to
share a house with an elderly couple.  What's worse is that they have to sleep
on the top half of a bunk bed, while the older couple slept on the lower half. 
Needless to say, the young couple wanted sex often.  Instead of asking the
question explicitly, for fear that they would be overheard, they agreed to use
the code "eating orange" for sex.
   So every night, the husband would ask his wife, "Honey, do you feel like
eating orange?".
   This went on for several weeks, until one night when the husband asked,
"Honey, do you feel like eating orange?", to which the old man from below
interrupted,
   "You know, I don't mind ya eating oranges so much, but could you please not
drip the orange juices down here!"
