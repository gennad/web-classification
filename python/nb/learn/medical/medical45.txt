After much soul searching and having determined the husband was infertile, the
childless couple decided to try artificial insemination.  When the woman showed
up at the clinic, she was told to undress from the waist down, get on the table
and place her feet in the stirrups.  She was feeling rather awkward about the
entire procedure when the doctor came in.  Her anxiety was not diminished by the
sight of him pulling down his pants!  "Wait a minute!  What the hell is going on
here?" yelped the woman, pulling herself into a sitting position.  "Don't you
want to get pregnant?" asked the doctor.  "Well, yes, I do," answered the woman.
"Then lie back and spread 'em," replied the doctor.  "We're all out of the
bottled stuff.  You'll just have to settle for what's on tap."
