A man who thought he was John the Baptist was disturbing the neighborhood, so
for public safety, he was committed.  He was put in a room with another crazy
and immediately began his routine, "I am John The Baptist!  Jesus Christ has
sent me!"  The other guy looks at him and declares, "I did *not*!"
