   Three old men are sitting on the porch of a retirement home.  The first says,
"Fellas, I got real problems.  I'm seventy years old.  Every morning at seven
o'clock I get up and I try to urinate.  All day long I try to urinate.  They
give me all kinds of medicine but nothing helps."
   The second old man says, "You think you have problems.  I'm eighty years old.
Every morning at 8:00 I get up and try to move my bowels.  I try all day long.
They give me all kinds of stuff but nothing helps."
   Finally the third old man speaks up, "Fellas: I'm ninety years old.  Every
morning at 7:00 sharp I urinate.  Every morning at 8:00 I move my bowels.  Every
morning at 9:00 sharp I wake up."
