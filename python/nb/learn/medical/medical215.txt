At a party, an Israeli doctor says: "Medicine is so advanced in our country,
that we can take a kidney from one person, and put it into another, and have him
looking for work in six weeks." A German doctor says: "We can take the heart and
the lungs from a cadaver, and transplant them into a living person, and he'll be
looking for work in three months." An American social worker says: "We took a
quarter million assholes from the USSR, and transplanted them to Brighton Beach,
and not a single one is looking for work!"
