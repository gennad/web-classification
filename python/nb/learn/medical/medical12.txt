   Patient: I'm in a hospital!  Why am I in here?
   Doctor:  You've had an accident involving a train.
   Patient: What happened?
   Doctor:  Well, I've got some good news and some bad news.  Which would you
like to hear first?
   Patient: Well...  The bad news first...
   Doctor:  Your legs were injured so badly that we had to amputate both of
them.
   Patient: That's terrible!  What's the good news?
   Doctor:  There's a guy in the next ward who made a very good offer on your
slippers.
