A pipe burst in a doctor's house.  He called a plumber.  The plumber arrived,
unpacked his tools, did mysterious plumber-type things for a while, and handed
the doctor a bill for $600.  The doctor exclaimed, "This is ridiculous!  I
don't even make that much as a doctor!."  The plumber waited for him to finish
and quietly said "Neither did I when I was a doctor."
