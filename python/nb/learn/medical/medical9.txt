   A woman decides that she's not amply enough endowed in the chest, so she goes
to her plastic surgeon about getting implants.
   "What are my options?" she asks the doctor.
   "Well," the doctor responded, "The very best, most realistic implants are
made of silicone."
   "Okay.  What's the price tag on those?"
   "$25,000."
   The woman sighed.  "I don't have $25,000 to spare.  Are there any other
options?"
   "The next best type of implants are rubber.  They're less realistic, but the
process is quite a bit cheaper, about $10,000."
   The woman shook her head.  "I'm afraid I just can't afford that.  Sorry I
wasted your time."
   "Wait," said the doctor.  "There is one more option, but it's in the
experimental stages.  If you're willing to try it out, it will be free."
   "Okay," said the woman cautiously.  "What kind of implants are these?"
   "Balloons," replied the doctor.  "It requires a less invasive procedure, but
they must be reinflated periodically."
   The woman decided to go for the operation.  It was successful, and when it
was all finished the doctor showed her how to inflate them, like this: {Put
fingers on chest just above bosom.  Move your elbows up and down like a chicken
flapping its wings.}  So, once she fully recovered, the woman went to a singles
bar.  She spied a likely-looking prospect on the other side of the bar.  She
walked over, making sure that her breasts were inflated {repeat chicken-wing
motion}.
   "Pardon me," she said to the man, "but haven't I seen you here before?"
   {say the following line while scissoring legs open and closed}  "No, but we
have the same doctor!"
