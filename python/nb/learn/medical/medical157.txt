A man goes to the doctor for a checkup.  After the checkup, the doctor tells the
man he has bad news.  "You only have six months to live."  The man sits for a
while thinking, and then says, "There's only one thing I can do, I'm going to
become a Communist."  The doctor says, "You've been a patriotic American all
your life, why are you going to become a Communist now?"  The man says, "Better
one of them should die than one of us."
