   A guy hasn't been feeling well for a while, so he goes to the doctor for a
check-up.  After he sees the doctor, the doc tells him he has a very serious
condition and would like to talk to his wife.  So the man leaves and sends his
wife in.  The doctor tells the wife that her husband has a very serious
condition and that he is going to die.  However, the doctor tells her that there
is one way she can save his life: She must cook him 3 meals a day and have sex
with him every night for 6 months and then he'll be OK.
   When the wife leaves the office her husband asks her what the doctor said. 
She looks at her husband and tells him, "He said you're gonna die."
