A waiter in a Brighton Beach restaurant is so harried, he has no time to go to
the bathroom, so he pisses into a big vat of borscht.  Later he serves the
borscht to a client whom he recognizes as his doctor.  He asks: "Doctor, do you
think this borscht too sweet?  Can you taste sugar?" The doctor tries it and
says, "No."  "Thank you, doctor!  The medicine you prescribed me must have
helped."
