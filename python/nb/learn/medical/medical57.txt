   A young mother had just given birth to a newborn baby and the nurse was
congratulating her when the doctor came in bouncing the baby from hand to hand
like a basketball.
   "Here's your baby, maam" says the doctor.
   The doctor then throws the baby on the floor, hurls it up against the wall,
picks it up and twirls it around several times, and then drop kicks it straight
out of the 10th floor window.
   Totally bewildered, the woman gives out a loud shriek and hollers "My God!!!
What have you done to my baby?!?!!!"
   The doctor chuckles a little to himself and says "April Fools!!!  He was
already dead!"
