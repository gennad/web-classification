A fellow goes to the doctor and says, "Doctor, I have this problem that I am
always farting all of the time.  Although they don't smell, they do make loud
noises, and it is affecting my social life." The doctor gives him some pills,
and asks him to return next week.  He returns, and says, "Those pills did no
good.  In fact they made things worse.  I still fart as much, but now they smell
terrible." To which the doctor replies, "Good!  Now that we have your nose
working again, lets work on your farting"
