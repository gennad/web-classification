In "Pissing in the Snow: Ozark Mountain Folktales", Vance Randolph tells of a
wizened old country doctor who could treat anything.  Well it seems one time,
one of the mountain folk came into his office with three complaints.  "Doc," he
said, "I can't taste nothin', I can't tell the truth, and I can't remember
nothin' besides."  Well the old Doc thought about this for a minute and went
back into the apothecary, and made of two capsules full with cow hooey, and gave
them both to the man, and telling him to take one immediately, chewing well.
Well, the man did as he was told, bit down and started chawing, then yelled out,
"Yeachhhh...  This stuff tastes like shee-it."  "Uh huh," the doctor said, "Well
I see that you can taste, and you're certainly telling the truth now.  And the
next time that you're memory is acting up, just take the other pill."  And the
old Doc charged the man fifteen bucks and sent him on his way, and never did
hear no trouble from him much after that.
