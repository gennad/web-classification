A patient goes to a Polish doctor:
   Patient: I am having a hard time hearing.  I cannot even hear myself cough.
   Doctor: Here is a prescription, take the midicine for 7 days, then return for
a checkup.

SEVEN DAYS LATER:
   Patient: Thanks a million, doctor.  At least, I can hear myself cough NOW. So
what did you do to make me hear better?
   Doctor: Not much, I gave you medicine that increased your cough.
