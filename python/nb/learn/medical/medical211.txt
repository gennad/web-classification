   Doctors at King's College Hospital in London reported that Baby, a two year
old collie-Doberman, was apparently responsible for detecting a malignant tumor
on her owner's thigh.  She ignored moles and other marks on the body but spent
several minutes each day sniffing the tumor, attempting twice to bite it off. 
After several weeks, the owner finally sought medical advice.

   A recent study noted in The Journal of the American Medical Association
reported that, of two groups that entered a San Francisco hospital with equally
bad heart problems, the group that enjoyed prayer support from others had fewer
complications.
