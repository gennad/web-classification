A woman goes to the doctors, and says, "Doctor, I've got a bit of a problem.
I'll have to take my clothes off to show you."  The doctor tells her to go
behind the screen and disrobe.  She does so, and the doctor goes round to see
her when she is ready.  "Well, what is it?" he asks.  "It's a bit embarrassing,"
she replies, "These two green circles have appeared on the inside of my thighs."
The doctor examines her and finally admits he has no idea what the cause is.
Then he suddenly asks, "Have you been having an affair with a gypsy lately?"
The woman blushes and says, "Well, actually I have."  "That's the problem," the
doctor says, "Tell him his ear-rings aren't made of gold!!!"
