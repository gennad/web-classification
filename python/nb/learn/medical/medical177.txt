A guy walks into a local pharmacy and walks up to the counter where a lady
pharmacist is filling prescriptions.  When she finally gets around to helping
him he says, "I'd like 99 condoms please".  With a surprised look on her face
the pharmacist says, "99 Condoms!?!  Fuck me!" to which the guy replies, "Make
it 100".
