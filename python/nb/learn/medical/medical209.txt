At an international meeting, to surgeons were having an argument.  The Indian
surgeon was saying "No no no, I am telling you it is Woomba" and the African
surgeon is saying "No Man, it is Whoooooommmmmm"  They go on like this for about
10 minutes.  Up comes the English surgeon, and interrupts them. "Excuse me
chaps, but I do believe that the word you are trying to say is "Womb."  After he
has gone away, the African turns to the Indian and says "I bet you he has never
even seen a hippopotamus, never mind heard one fart under water.
