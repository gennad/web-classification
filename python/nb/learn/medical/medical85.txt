This guy goes to his doctor to ask him a question.  The doctor says, "What can
I do for you?"  "Well doctor, I have a question for you.  I masturbate, and I
was wondering how often is too often."  "Hmmm," the doctor says, "how often do
you do it?"  "Three times a day." the man says.  "Yeah, that might be a little
excessive.  Have you considered finding yourself a girlfriend?"  "I have a
girlfriend, doctor", says the man.  "I mean a girlfriend for the bedroom as
well...", the doctor says.  The man says "Oh, she is, that's not the problem.
The problem is, she doesn't like to do it during mealtimes."
