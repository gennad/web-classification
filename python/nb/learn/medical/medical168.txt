   One night, as a couple lay down for bed, the husband gently taps his wife on
the shoulder and starts rubbing her arm.  The wife turns over and says "I'm
sorry honey, I've got a gynecologist appointment tomorrow and I want to stay
fresh."
   The husband, rejected, turns over and tries to sleep.  A few minutes later,
he rolls back over and taps his wife again.
   This time he whispers in her ear, "Do you have a dentist appointment tomorrow
too?."
