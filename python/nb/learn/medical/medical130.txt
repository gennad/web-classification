A man was walking along a sidewalk in a very gentle manner, almost as if he were
walking on eggs.  Two doctors, also on foot, were across the street.  They
spotted the man and began to discuss his condition.  "Prostrate trouble", said
the first doctor.  "Oh no, not at all.  That's a case of hemorrhoids if ever I
saw one", said the other.  They tossed it back and forth until one of them
suggested going over to talk to the man.  "Mr, this gentleman and I are both
doctors", said one, "and if you'll pardon our intrusion, I figured you have a
bad prostrate problem, but my colleague thought it to be hemorrhoids.  Might you
state the problem so that we can solve our little dilemma?"  "Well", said the
man, "all three of us were wrong.  I thought it was gas."
