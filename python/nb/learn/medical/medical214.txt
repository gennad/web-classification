An American, an Englishman and a Japanese fellow were discussing their
respective countries over drink at a London pub one evening.  The English fellow
mentioned how that British medicine had progressed so far that doctors recently
had taken a single liver and cut it into six pieces then transplanted it into
six separate men in need of a healthy liver.  This had resulted in six new
workers in the job market.  At this, the Japanese guy said that in his country
doctors had cut a lung into twelve pieces, transplanted these into twelve people
in need of healthy lungs, thereby putting twelve new people in the job market.
Not to be outdone, the American said "That's nothing.  In the U. S., we took
one asshole, made it President, and now there are 10 million people in the
market for a job!"
