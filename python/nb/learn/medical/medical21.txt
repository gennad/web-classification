There are three Jewish mothers bragging about their sons.  The first one says
"My son is very successful.  He is the best lawyer in New York City." The second
one says "My son has done better than that.  He is the best Doctor in New York
City."  The third one says "My son has not done that well.  He does not have a
very good job, and he is homosexual.  But he has these two great boyfriends....
One is the best lawyer in New York City, and the other is the best doctor in the
city."
