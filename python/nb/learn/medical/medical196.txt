The head doctors in an insane asylum had a meeting and decided that one of their
patients was potentially well.  So they decide to test him and take him to the
movies.  When they get to the movie theatre, there are signs of wet paint
pointing to the benches.  The doctors just sit down, but the patient puts a
newspaper down first and then sits down.  The doctors get all excited cause they
think maybe he's in touch with reality now.  So they ask him, "Why did you put
the newspaper down first?"  He answers, "So I'd be higher and have a better
view."
