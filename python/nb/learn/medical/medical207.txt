   A man goes into the hospital for a vasectomy.
   Shortly after he recovers from his an anesthetic, his surgeon comes in and
tells him: "Well, I've got good news and I've got bad news for you."
   "Give me the bad news first, Doc." says the patient.
   "I'm afraid that we accidentally cut your balls off during surgery, son."
   "Oh my god!" the patient cries, breaking into tears.
   "But the good news", the doctor adds, "is that we had them biopsied and
you'll be relieved to know that they weren't malignant!"
