A man is having problems with his dick which certainly had seen better times...
He consults a doctor which, after a couple of tests, says, "Sorry, but you've
overdone it the last 30 years, your dick is burned out; you won't be able to
make love more than 30 times!"  The man walks home (deeply depressed); his wife
is already expecting him at the front door and asks him what the doctor said
concerning his problem.  He tells her what the doc told him.  She says: "Oh my
god, only 30 times!  We should not waste that; we should make a list!"  He
replies, "Yes, i already made a list on the way home; sorry your name is not on it!"
