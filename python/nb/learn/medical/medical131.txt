   A doctor dies and goes to heaven.  St. Peter meets him at the pearly gates
and checks him in.  After he's registered, St. Peter says to him "Look at the
time: you must be hungry!  Heaven Cafeteria is serving lunch, why don't you get
yourself something to eat?"
   The doctor goes to the cafeteria and notices the long line.  He immediately
cuts in at the front, only to hear loud protests.  "I'm a doctor" he says, "I'm
a busy man, I don't have time to wait in line."
   The others say "You're in heaven now, we're all the same here, get to the
back of the line and wait your turn!"
   A few weeks later, waiting patiently on line for lunch, the doctor notices a
man come dashing in wearing scrubs and a lab coat, stethoscope around his neck. 
He butts in at the head of the line and no-one utters a peep.  "Hey," he says to
the guy in front of him, "Who does that guy think he is?"
   "Oh, that's God," says the guy, "He likes to play doctor."
