Syadov walks into the Moscow health clinic and asks to see an ear-and-eye
doctor.  The nurse explains to him that there isn't a specialist in those two
areas at the clinic, but tells him that they have an eye-doctor AND an ear,
nose, and throat man.  She further goes on to suggest, after seeing his rather
vacant stare, that he see the ENT specialist, and, if that doesn't work, why
then he can go to the ophthalmologist.  So a month later (Remember, the clinic
is run by the Soviet bureaucracy) he is shown to the doc's office. The following
dialogue ensues.  Doctor: So, tell me, Comrade Syadov.  What seems to be the
trouble?  Syadov: DOC!  DOC!  Ya GOTTA help me!  I'm going crazy!  Doctor:  Just
calm down, and tell me your symptoms.  Syadov: Well, I..  OK.  I...  I'll try.
It's like my ears and my eyeballs aren't connected to the same man.  I can't see
what I hear, and I can't hear what I see!  At this, the doctor sighs, shakes his
head, closes his notebook, and prepares for his next patient.  When Syadov asks
what he's doing, he explains:  "Really, I'm very sorry, Comrade.  But there's no
known cure for Communism."
