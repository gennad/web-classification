"HOW DID IT HAPPEN?" the doctor asked the middle-aged farmhand as he set the
man's broken leg.  "Well, doc, 25 years ago ..."  "Never mind the past.  Tell me
how you broke your leg this morning."  "Like I was saying...  25 years ago, when
I first started working on the farm, that night, right after I'd gone to bed,
the farmer's beautiful daughter came into my room.  She asked me if there was
anything I wanted.  I said no, everything is fine. "Are you sure?", she asked.
"I'm sure, I said.  "Isn't there anything I can do for you?" she wanted to know.
"I reckon not" I replied...  "Excuse me," said the doctor, "What does this story
have to do with your leg?"  "Well, this morning," the farmhand explained, "when
it dawned on me what she meant, I fell off the roof!"
