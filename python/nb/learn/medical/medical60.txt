   How many doctors does it take to screw in a light bulb?
   That depends on whether it has health insurance.
   Three.  One to find a bulb specialist, one to find a bulb installation
specialist, and one to bill it all to Medicare.
   None.  They just tell it to take two aspirin and come round to the surgery
later.
   None.  They only sign the death certificate and phone the mortuary.
   None.  They would diagnose depression and prescribe benzo diazapines.
