A woman goes to her doctor who verifies that she is pregnant.  This is her first
pregnancy.  The doctor asks her if she has any questions.  She replies, "Well,
I'm a little worried about the pain.  How much will childbirth hurt?" The doctor
answered, "Well, that varies from woman to woman and pregnancy to pregnancy and
besides, it's difficult to describe pain."  "I know, but can't you give me some
idea?," she asks.  "Grab your upper lip and pull it out a little..."  "Like
this?"  "A little more..."  "Like this?"  "No.  A little more..."  "Like this?"
"Yes.  Does that hurt?"  "A little bit."  "Now stretch it over your head!"
