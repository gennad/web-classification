A woman went to her doctor for a follow-up visit after the doctor had prescribed
testosterone (a male hormone) for her.  She was a little worried about some of
the side effects she was experiencing.  "Doctor, the hormones you've been giving
me have really helped, but I'm afraid that you're giving me too much.  I've
started growing hair in places that I've never grown hair before."  The doctor
reassured her.  "A little hair growth is a perfectly normal side effect of
testosterone.  Just where has this hair appeared?"  "On my balls."
