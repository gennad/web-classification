   A man and a woman were waiting at the hospital donation center.
   Man: "What are you doing here today?"
   Woman: "Oh, I'm here to donate some blood.  They're going to give me $5 for
it."
   Man: "Hmm, that's interesting.  I'm here to donate sperm, myself.  But they
pay me $25."
   The woman looked thoughtful for a moment and they chatted some more before
going their separate ways.  Several months later, the same man and woman meet
again in the donation center.
   Man: "Oh, hi there!  Here to donate blood again?"
   Woman: [shaking her head with mouth closed] "Unh unh."
