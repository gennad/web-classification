   A woman goes to the hospital to visit a girlfriend who is about to have a
heart transplant.  She's worried about the friend so she asks the doctor...
   Girlfriend: I'm worried about my friend doc, what if her body rejects the
organ?
   Doctor: Well, she's 36 years old and healthy.  How long has she been in
business?
   Girlfriend: She's been working since she was 19 years old but what does that
have to do with anything?
   Doctor: Well, she's been working 17 years and hasn't rejected an organ yet!
