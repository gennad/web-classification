Everywhere this lady went, nobody wanted to talk to her, no one ever asked her
to go out.  Guys came up to her and turned away.  She wondered why this would
happen.  So she went to her doctor and told him what was going on.  She thought
that maybe there was a problem with her.  The doctor told her he would give her
a complete exam.  He told her to undress and get up on the table, so she did.
He told her to open her mouth and he checked it.  Then he asked her to get down
from the table and bend over.  He then said to the lady, "Know what your problem
is, you have zactly."  The lady then asked, "What is zactly?"  The doctor said,
"Lady your mouth smells zactly like your ass."
