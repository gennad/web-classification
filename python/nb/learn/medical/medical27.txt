An elderly woman went into the doctor's office.  When the doctor asked why she
was there, she replied, "I'd like to have some birth control pills."  Taken
aback, the doctor thought for a minute and then said, "Excuse me, Mrs. Smith,
but you're 75 years old.  What possible use could you have for birth control
pills?"  The woman responded, "They help me sleep better."  The doctor thought
some more and continued, "How in the world do birth control pills help you to
sleep?"  The woman said, "I put them in my granddaughter's orange juice and I
sleep better at night."
