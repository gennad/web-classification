   This guy goes to the doctor for a vasectomy.  Unlike the usual patients, he
shows up in a limo, and he's sitting in the doctor's office in a rented tuxedo
with black tie.
   The doctor says "I've done a lot of these, but I've never seen a limo and
tuxedo before.  What's the story?"
   To which the fellow responds "If I'm gonna BE im-potent, I'm gonna LOOK
im-potent!"
