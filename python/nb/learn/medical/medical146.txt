   A woman has just started to play golf when she gets stung on the arm by a
bee.  She rushes back to the clubhouse, hoping to find a doctor.  She asks "Is
anyone here a doctor?."
   One guy, who was pretty drunk, stands up and says "I'm a doctor, what can I
help you with?"
   "I've been stung by a bee."
   "Oh really, where?"
   "Between the first and second hole"
   "Well, first of all, your stance is too wide..."
