A veterinarian was feeling ill and went to see her doctor.  The doctor asked her
all the usual questions, about symptoms, how long had they been occurring, etc.,
when she interrupted him: "Hey look, I'm a vet - I don't need to ask my patients
these kind of questions: I can tell what's wrong just by looking.  Why can't
you?"  The doctor nodded, looked her up and down, wrote out a prescription, and
handed it to her and said, "There you are.  Of course, if *that* doesn't work,
we'll have to have you put down."
