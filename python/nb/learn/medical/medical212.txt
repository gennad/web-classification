An young man, on his first visit to a big city decides to go visit the local
whorehouse.  A little while later he starts to feel sick.  He goes to see a
doctor of internal medicine.  The doctor examines him and says, "Well son, I
don't know how to tell you this, but you've got a bad case of syphilis,
gonorrhea, and about 12 other things I can't spell.  I'm afraid I'm going to
have to give you this medicine.  It'll make you get better but it'll also cause
your penis to shrivel up and disappear.  It's going to cost you $1000."  This
doesn't make our friend very happy so he goes and sees a surgeon.  The surgeon
examines him and says "Sorry, but it looks like a nice mix of syphilis,
gonorrhea, and a few other things to boot.  Afraid I'm going to have to cut your
dick off and charge you $2000."  By this time the guy is desperate so he goes to
see a doctor of holistic medicine.  The doctor examines him and comes to
essentially the same conclusion as the other doctors: an advanced case of V. D.
However, his approach to the problem is designed to save the patient unnecessary
expense, trauma, and worry: "Look, just go home and eat lots of good food, get
plenty of rest, and gets lots of sunshine and fresh air.  Wait about two weeks
and your dick will fall off all by itself."
