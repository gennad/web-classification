A well known rich businessman's wife broke her hip.  The businessman got the
best bone surgeon in town to do the operation.  The operation consisted of
lining up the broken hip and putting in a screw to secure it.  The operation
went fine, and the doctor sent the business man a fee for his services of $5000.
The businessman was outraged at the cost, and sent the doctor a letter demanding
an itemized list of the costs.  The doctor sent back a list with two things:

1 screw                   $   1
Knowing how to put it in  $4999
                          $5000 total

The businessman never argued.
