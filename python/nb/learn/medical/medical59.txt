A blond guy visits the hospital.  "I want to be castrated!" he demands
cheerfully.  "Are you sure about this?" the doctor asks. "Have you discussed it
with your wife?"  "Yes, yes!  I've thought about this for a long time.  Let's
get it over with!"  So, the operation is performed.  Since it's relatively
simple, the blond guy only has to stay in the hospital for two days.  On his way
home, he meets a friend.  "Well, hello!  I haven't seen you for a couple of
days," his friend says.  "No, I've been to the hospital," replies the blond.
"Well, that's funny.  I'm on my way there right now!"  "Really?  So, what's up?"
"I'm going to be vaccinated."  "Oh, shit!!  That's what it's called!"
