There was this eighty-year-old man who was seeing the doctor for a checkup.  The
doctor asked why he needed the checkup.  The man was getting married next month
to a girl 60 years his junior.  The doctor tried to talk him out of the
marriage, and it didn't work.  However, the doctor suggested, "If you want your
marriage to last, I say you at least take in a boarder."  The old man agreed.
The old man didn't see the doctor for a year, when they met at a fund-raiser.
The old man says, "Doc, congratulate me, my wife is pregnant."  "That's good
news," said the doctor.  "I knew the boarder would help."  "Oh," said the old
man with a wicked grin, "and the boarder's pregnant as well."
