There was a businessman, and he was feeling really crook, and he went to see the
Doctor about it.  The doctor says to him "Well, it must be your diet, what sort
of greens do you eat?" and the man replies "Well, actually, I only eat peas, I
hate all other green foods."  The doctor was quite shocked at this and says
"Well man, that's your problem, all those peas will be clogging up your system,
you'll have to give them up!!."  The guy says "But how long for, I mean I really
like peas!" and the doctor replies "Forever, I'm afraid."  The man is quite
shocked by this, but he gives it a go and sure enough, his condition improves,
so he realizes that he will never eat a pea again.  Anyway, one night, years
later, he's at a convention for his employer and getting quite sloshed and one
of the reps says "Well, ashully, I'd love a cigarette, coz I avint ad a smoke in
four years, I gave it up."  Quite a shocker really, and the barman goes,
"Really, I haven't had a game of golf in 3 years, because it cost me my first
marriage, so I gave it up!" and the businessman says "Thas nuvving, I haven't ad
a pea in 6 years" and the barman jumps up screaming "OK, everyone who can't
swim, grab a table...."
