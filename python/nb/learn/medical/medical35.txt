An 80 year woman married an 85 year old man.  After about six months together,
the woman wasn't feeling well and she went to her doctor.  The doctor examined
and said, "Congratulations Mrs. Jones, you're going to be a mother."  "Get
serious Doctor, I'm 80."  "I know," said the Doctor, "This morning I would have
said it was impossible, but this afternoon you are a medical miracle."  "I'll be
damned," she replied and stormed out of the office.  She walked down the hall
and around the corner to where the telephones were.  In a rage, she dialed her
husband.  "Hello" she heard in his familiar halting voice.  She screamed, "You
rotten son of a bitch.  You got me pregnant!"  There was a pause on the line.
Finally her husband answered "Who's calling please?."
