A Jewish boy was walking with his girlfriend on the grounds of his father's
house.  His father was a successful doctor, and was carrying out a circumcision
in the on-site surgery.  As they were walking, they heard a scream and a
foreskin flew out of the window and landed at the girl's feet.  "What's this,"
she asked.  "Taste it," he replied, "If you like it, I'll give you a whole one!"
