A Soviet emigre boy and girl come to a doctor's office and say: "Doctor, we
would like to know if we are screwing properly.  Will you watch us, please?"
The doctor, somewhat puzzled, agrees, they climb on his table, the boy gets on
top of the girl, and they have sex.  After observing them, the doctor says,
"Yes, you're having sex properly.  That will be forty dollars." They come back
the next day with the same request, but this time the boy enters the girl from
the rear.  They keep coming for four days in a row, using different positions
every day.  On the fifth visit the doctor says, "Why do you keep on coming back?
I told you you're having sex properly." The boy explains, "The hotel room
costs the same forty dollars, but this way we get reimbursed by Medicaid."
