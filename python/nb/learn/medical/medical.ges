Then there's the woman who goes to the dentist.  As he leans over to begin
working on her, she grabs his balls.  The dentist says, "Madam, I believe you've
got a hold of my privates."  The woman replies, "Yes.  We're going to be careful
not to hurt each other, aren't we."

A businessman was in Japan to make a presentation to the Toyota motor people.
Needless to say, this was an especially important deal, and it was imperative
that he make the best possible impression.  On the morning of the presentation
he awoke to find himself passing gas, in large volumes, with the unpleasant
characteristic of sounding like "HONDA."  The man was besides himself.  Every
few minutes "HONDA", "HONDA"....  Unable to stop this aberrant behavior, and in
desperate need to terminate these odious and rather embarrassing emissions, he
sought a physicians aid.  After a full examination, the doctor told him that
there was nothing inherently wrong with him and that he would just have to wait
it out.  Being unwilling to accept this state of affairs he visited a second
and then a third doctor all of whom told him the same thing.  Finally one medic
suggested that he visit a dentist.  Well although he could not see how a
dentist was going to be of any help, he visited one anyway.  Lo and behold, the
dentist said, "Ah, there's the problem"  "What is it?" the man asked.  "Why you
have an abscess," said the dentist.  "An abscess.  How could that be causing my
problem?" asked the man.  "That's easy," replied the dentist.  "Why everyone
knows...  Abscess makes the fart go Honda."

   One day a man walked into the dentist"s office for some dental work.
   The dentist said "Sir, you have a tooth I must pull, What type of pain killer
would you like?"
   The man looked at the dentist and said "None, thanks, I have experienced the
second greatest pain in my life."
   The dentist said "Sir, pulling this tooth Will be painful, I suggest a
painkiller"
   The man looked back at the dentist and said "I have experienced the second
greatest pain in my life, Nothing else will ever compare."
   The dentist said "Sir, I"m telling you, use a painkiller."
   The man again said to the dentist "I have experienced the second greatest
pain in my life, I do not need painkillers, now pull the tooth."
   The dentist then said "OK, You asked for it, But first, tell me what was the
second greatest pain in your life?"
   The man said "Yes, I remember it well. I was hunting in some woods north of
here one snowy day. Walking through the woods, the urge came upon me and I
headed over to a tree. Well, I started to do my thing, and when the first part
dropped, It set off a large bear trap that was hidden in the snow that closed on
my balls. That was the second greatest pain in my life"
   The dentist then said "Ouch!, But then what was the first greatest pain in
your life?"
   The man replied, "When I reached the end of the chain."

   A woman decides that she's not amply enough endowed in the chest, so she goes
to her plastic surgeon about getting implants.
   "What are my options?" she asks the doctor.
   "Well," the doctor responded, "The very best, most realistic implants are
made of silicone."
   "Okay.  What's the price tag on those?"
   "$25,000."
   The woman sighed.  "I don't have $25,000 to spare.  Are there any other
options?"
   "The next best type of implants are rubber.  They're less realistic, but the
process is quite a bit cheaper, about $10,000."
   The woman shook her head.  "I'm afraid I just can't afford that.  Sorry I
wasted your time."
   "Wait," said the doctor.  "There is one more option, but it's in the
experimental stages.  If you're willing to try it out, it will be free."
   "Okay," said the woman cautiously.  "What kind of implants are these?"
   "Balloons," replied the doctor.  "It requires a less invasive procedure, but
they must be reinflated periodically."
   The woman decided to go for the operation.  It was successful, and when it
was all finished the doctor showed her how to inflate them, like this: {Put
fingers on chest just above bosom.  Move your elbows up and down like a chicken
flapping its wings.}  So, once she fully recovered, the woman went to a singles
bar.  She spied a likely-looking prospect on the other side of the bar.  She
walked over, making sure that her breasts were inflated {repeat chicken-wing
motion}.
   "Pardon me," she said to the man, "but haven't I seen you here before?"
   {say the following line while scissoring legs open and closed}  "No, but we
have the same doctor!"

Scene: doctor talking to a patient lying in a hospital bed
"Your condition is so rare, we're not sure we're pronouncing it right."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Doctor:  I have some bad news and some very bad news.
   Patient: Well, might as well give me the bad news first.
   Doctor:  The lab called with your test results.  They said you have 24 hours
to live.
   Patient: 24 HOURS!  That's terrible!!  WHAT could be WORSE?  What's the very
bad news?
   Doctor:  I've been trying to reach you since yesterday.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Patient: I'm in a hospital!  Why am I in here?
   Doctor:  You've had an accident involving a train.
   Patient: What happened?
   Doctor:  Well, I've got some good news and some bad news.  Which would you
like to hear first?
   Patient: Well...  The bad news first...
   Doctor:  Your legs were injured so badly that we had to amputate both of
them.
   Patient: That's terrible!  What's the good news?
   Doctor:  There's a guy in the next ward who made a very good offer on your
slippers.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Doctor:  I have some good news and I have some bad news, which shall I tell
first?
   Patient: Do begin with the bad news, please.
   Doctor:  All Right.  Your son has drowned, your daughter has been raped, your
wife has divorced you, your house got blown away, and you have AIDS.
   Patient: Good grief!  What's the good news?
   Doctor:  The good news is that there is no more bad news.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Doctor: We need to get these people to a hospital!
Nurse:  What is it?
Doctor: It's a big building with a lot of doctors, but that's not important now!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Doctor:  Does it hurt when you do this?
Patient: Yes.
Doctor:  Well, don't do that.

Doctor:  Have you ever had this before?
Patient: Yes.
Doctor:  Well, you've got it again.

   A doctor is talking to a car mechanic:
   "Your debit is several times more per hour then we get paid for medical

   "Yea, but you see, doc, you have always the same model, it hasn't changed
since Adam; but we have to keep up to date with new models coming every month."

   A woman goes to a doctor with a problem.  She's sat on the chair next to the
doctor, and she's very hesitant about describing her problem.  Eventually, the
doctor manages to discover that she thinks she may be sexually perverted.  "What
sort of perversion are you talking about?" asks the doctor.  "Well," said the
woman, "I like to be...  Ohh...  Ah...  Ummm...  I'm sorry doctor, but I'm too
ashamed to talk about it."  "Come, come, my dear.  I'm a doctor you know; I've
been trained to understand these problems.  So what's the matter ...?"  So the
woman again tried to explain, but got so embarrassed that she just turned bright
red and looked as though she might faint.  It was then the doctor had a bright
idea.  "Look," he said, "I'm a bit of a pervert myself.  So if you show me what
your perversion is, I'll show you what mine is.  Ok?  Is it a deal?"  The woman
considered the offer, and after a short while agreed that it was a fair request.
So after a slight pause she said "Well my perversion is...  My perversion...
oh...  I like to be kissed on the bottom!"  "Shit Is that ALL!" said the doctor.
"Look, go behind that screen, take all your clothes off, and I'll come round and
show you what MY perversion is! Hee Hee!"  So the woman does as she is told, and
undresses behind the screen.  She gets down on all fours thinking to herself,
"Hmmmm, perhaps he might kiss me on the bum."  Anyway, 15 minutes pass and
nothing has happened.  So the woman peers around the side of the screen to see
the doctor sitting behind his desk, his feet up on the table, reading a
newspaper and whistling to himself.  "Hey!" shouted the woman, "I thought you
said you were a pervert?"  "Oh I am," said the doctor, "I've just shit in your
handbag."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The patient shook his doctor's hand in gratitude and said, "Since we are the
best of friends, I would not want to insult you by offering payment.  But I
would like for you to know that I had mentioned you in my will."  "That is very
kind of you," said the doctor emotionally, and then added, "Can I see that
prescription I just gave you?  I'd like to make a little change..."

   Doctor: That is an unusual complaint.  Take off your clothes and lay, stomach
down, on the couch.
   The man does as he is told.  The doctor examines him for a minute - the man
farting all the time this is going on.
   Doctor: Aha!  This should be easy to cure.  Excuse me for a moment.
   The doctor goes over to a closet and pulls out a long pole with a sharp spike
at one end.
   Man: (FAART!) Oh my God!  (fart..)  What are you going to do with (FFFARTT!!)
that?!
   Doctor: I need to open a window.

One is the best lawyer in New York City, and the other is the best doctor in the
city."

"HOW DID IT HAPPEN?" the doctor asked the middle-aged farmhand as he set the
man's broken leg.  "Well, doc, 25 years ago ..."  "Never mind the past.  Tell me
how you broke your leg this morning."  "Like I was saying...  25 years ago, when
I first started working on the farm, that night, right after I'd gone to bed,
the farmer's beautiful daughter came into my room.  She asked me if there was
anything I wanted.  I said no, everything is fine. "Are you sure?", she asked.
"I'm sure, I said.  "Isn't there anything I can do for you?" she wanted to know.
"I reckon not" I replied...  "Excuse me," said the doctor, "What does this story
have to do with your leg?"  "Well, this morning," the farmhand explained, "when
it dawned on me what she meant, I fell off the roof!"

There was two businessmen, whose names happened to be Mr Turtle and Mr Carrot,
and one day as they were coming back from lunch Mr Turtle says to Mr Carrot,
"You know, you're getting fat", to which Mr Carrot says "You're not so slim
yourself!."  So Mr Turtle says "OK, we'll see who is the least fit, race you
back to the office"  So the race starts, and they'd only got about a block down
the street when Mr Turtle crosses the road in front of a car and gets bowled.
Mr Carrot sees that he's in a pretty bad way, so he rushes to the phone and
calls Mr Cabbage, the ambulance driver.  Mr Cabbage duly arrives and piles Mr
Turtle into the Ambulance and rushes to hospital.  Mr Turtle follows and as soon
as he gets to the Hospital he asks the nurse at Accident and Emergency,  Miss
Cauliflower, whether he will be alright.  "Miss Cauliflower, Miss Cauliflower,
will Mr Turtle be alright?" she replies "Well, i couldn't really say, you'll
have to ask Dr Bean."  So he rushes over to Doctor Bean and says, "Doctor Bean,
Doctor Bean, will Mr Turtle be alright?" and the Doctor says "Well, I wouldn't
like to say, you'd best ask the specialist, Doctor Pea", so of course, Mr Carrot
rushes over to Doctor Pea and says "Doctor Pea, Doctor Pea, will Mr Turtle be
alright?", and Doctor Pea says "I've done all I can for him, it's all in the
hands of the Surgeon, Dr Turnip"  So Mr Carrot waits outside the surgery for 3
hours until they have finished the operation, and rushes up to Dr Turnip and
says "Doctor Turnip, Doctor Turnip, will Mr Turtle be alright?" and Dr Turnip
turns to him and says "We did all we could, but I'm afraid he'll be a vegetable
for the rest of his life..."

One night in the pub, the publican is lamenting the fact that business is so
quiet on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays.  As he moans to some of the regulars
a stranger, dressed in a tweed jacket and wearing glasses wanders over and says,
"I'm sorry, but I couldn't help overhearing your conversation.  I'm a doctor at
the lunatic asylum up the road and I'm trying to integrate some of the more sane
individuals into the community.  Why don't I bring some of my patients along,
say next Tuesday.  You'll have some customers and my patients will have a night
out." Well, the publican isn't sure but the thought of more paying customers on
a quiet night appeals, so he agrees.  So, the following Tuesday the guy in the
tweed jacket and glasses shows up with about ten lunatics.  He says to the
publican, "Give them whatever they want, put it on a tab and I'll settle up at
closing time." The publican has a great time selling loads of drinks and
encouraging the loonies to eat crisps and peanuts.  The loonies have a great
time, getting drunk but they behave themselves.  At closing time the publican
adds up the bill and it comes to just over a hundred pounds!  The guy with the
glasses and the tweed jacket starts to organize the loonies ready to take them
back to the asylum.  Finally he comes over and asks for the bill.  The publican,
feeling that he's charged them rather a lot and feeling he should do his bit to
help these poor unfortunate people gives him a discount. "Its eighty quid," he
says.  The guy in the tweed jacket smiles and says, "That's fine.  Have you got
change for a dustbin lid?"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A man goes to the doctor and says, "Doc, I would like to live very long.  What
should I do?" "I think that is a wise decision," the doctor replies. "Let's see,
do you smoke?"  "Oh..  Half a pack a day." "Starting NOW, no more smoking."  The
man agrees.  The doctor then asks, "Do you drink?" "Oh, well Doc, not much, just
a bit of wine with my meals, and a beer or two every once in a while." "Starting
now, you drink only water.  No exceptions." The man is a bit upset, but also
agrees.  The doctor asks, "How do you eat?"  "Oh, well, you know, Doc, normal
stuff."  "Starting now you are going on a very strict diet: you are going to eat
only raw vegetables, with no dressing, and non-fat cottage cheese." The man is
now really worried.  "Doc, is all this really necessary?"  "Do you want to live
long?"  "Yes."  "Absolutely necessary.  And don't even think of breaking the
diet.  "The man is quite restless, but the doctor continues, "Do you have sex?"
"Yeah, once a week or so..., only with my wife!" he adds hurriedly.  "As soon as
you get out of here you are going to buy twin beds.  No more sex for you.
None." The man is appalled.  "Doc...  Are you sure I'm going to live longer this
way?" "I have no idea, but whatever you live, I assure you is going to seem like
an eternity!"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A guy goes to his doctor and is told that he has 6 months to live.
"6 months!!" he exclaimed.  "What am I supposed to do in only 6 months?"
His doctor told him, "Marry a JAP and move to Montana."
"Why?" the guy asked.
"Because 6 months will seem like an eternity!"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

An elderly woman went into the doctor's office.  When the doctor asked why she
was there, she replied, "I'd like to have some birth control pills."  Taken
aback, the doctor thought for a minute and then said, "Excuse me, Mrs. Smith,
but you're 75 years old.  What possible use could you have for birth control
pills?"  The woman responded, "They help me sleep better."  The doctor thought
some more and continued, "How in the world do birth control pills help you to
sleep?"  The woman said, "I put them in my granddaughter's orange juice and I
sleep better at night."

   A man and a woman were waiting at the hospital donation center.
   Man: "What are you doing here today?"
   Woman: "Oh, I'm here to donate some blood.  They're going to give me $5 for
it."
   Man: "Hmm, that's interesting.  I'm here to donate sperm, myself.  But they
pay me $25."
   The woman looked thoughtful for a moment and they chatted some more before
going their separate ways.  Several months later, the same man and woman meet
again in the donation center.
   Man: "Oh, hi there!  Here to donate blood again?"
   Woman: [shaking her head with mouth closed] "Unh unh."

A veterinarian was feeling ill and went to see her doctor.  The doctor asked her
all the usual questions, about symptoms, how long had they been occurring, etc.,
when she interrupted him: "Hey look, I'm a vet - I don't need to ask my patients
these kind of questions: I can tell what's wrong just by looking.  Why can't
you?"  The doctor nodded, looked her up and down, wrote out a prescription, and
handed it to her and said, "There you are.  Of course, if *that* doesn't work,
we'll have to have you put down."

   While doing a vasectomy, the doctor slipped and cut off one of the man's
balls.  To avoid a huge malpractice suit, he decides to replace the missing ball
with an onion.  Several weeks later, the patient returned for a checkup.
   "How's your sex life?" the doctor asked.
   "Pretty good," the man said, to the doctor's relief.  But then he added,
"I've had some strange side effects."
   "What's that?" the doctor asked anxiously.
   "Well, every time I piss, my eyes water.  When my wife gives me a blow job,
she gets heartburn.  And every time I pass a hamburger stand, I get a hard-on."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A woman goes to her doctor who verifies that she is pregnant.  This is her first
pregnancy.  The doctor asks her if she has any questions.  She replies, "Well,
I'm a little worried about the pain.  How much will childbirth hurt?" The doctor
answered, "Well, that varies from woman to woman and pregnancy to pregnancy and
besides, it's difficult to describe pain."  "I know, but can't you give me some
idea?," she asks.  "Grab your upper lip and pull it out a little..."  "Like
this?"  "A little more..."  "Like this?"  "No.  A little more..."  "Like this?"
"Yes.  Does that hurt?"  "A little bit."  "Now stretch it over your head!"

A woman is laying on a gurney out in the hall prior to going to surgery.  As she
lays there, a man in a white coat comes by, lifts up the sheet, and then leaves.
This happens a second time.  The third time this happens, she says "Doctor, am I
going into surgery soon?"  The man replies, "Don't ask me lady.  I'm just a
painter!"

An 80 year woman married an 85 year old man.  After about six months together,
the woman wasn't feeling well and she went to her doctor.  The doctor examined
and said, "Congratulations Mrs. Jones, you're going to be a mother."  "Get
serious Doctor, I'm 80."  "I know," said the Doctor, "This morning I would have
said it was impossible, but this afternoon you are a medical miracle."  "I'll be
damned," she replied and stormed out of the office.  She walked down the hall
and around the corner to where the telephones were.  In a rage, she dialed her
husband.  "Hello" she heard in his familiar halting voice.  She screamed, "You
rotten son of a bitch.  You got me pregnant!"  There was a pause on the line.
Finally her husband answered "Who's calling please?."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   This guy goes to the doctor for a vasectomy.  Unlike the usual patients, he
shows up in a limo, and he's sitting in the doctor's office in a rented tuxedo
with black tie.
   The doctor says "I've done a lot of these, but I've never seen a limo and
tuxedo before.  What's the story?"
   To which the fellow responds "If I'm gonna BE im-potent, I'm gonna LOOK
im-potent!"

   There was a country doctor who was the only doctor for miles around.  He
wanted to go on a fishing trip so he called the vet and asked him to look after
things while he was gone.
   The vet asked, "Is anything happening?"
    The doctor replied, "Mrs. Jones is about due, but I don't think the baby
will come before I get back.  Anyway, if it does, just deliver it.  This is her
third and the first two went really easily."
   The vet said "OK" and the doctor went on the fishing trip.
   When he returned, he called the vet.  "How did things go while I was gone?"
   "Pretty good."
   "Did Mrs. Jones have her baby?"
   "Yes, it was a 8 pound boy.  Everyone's doing fine."
   "Did you have any trouble?"
   "Well, there was just one little problem."
   "What was that?"
   "I had a terrible time getting her to eat the afterbirth!"

   One day, John's tennis elbow was acting up and he decided to stop in and see
a doctor.  When he got to the doctor's office the nurse told him he could see
the doctor in 15 minutes but, first he'd have to give a urine sample.  John said
that this was absurd but, the nurse insisted and John complied.  15 minutes
later, John was ushered in to see the doctor.
   "So that tennis elbow is really acting up, huh?" the doctor said.
   "The nurse must have told you," said John, wondering how the Doctor knew. 
   "No.  It was in your urinalysis." and the doctor continued to say that he had
just purchased this new machine that could diagnose every physical condition
with total accuracy based on the urine contents.  John didn't believe a word of
this but he did agree to provide another urine sample on check-up visit.
   Two days later, John was sitting at the kitchen table with his wife and his
teenage daughter.  He was telling them about this ridiculous machine.  When John
decided to have a little fun with the doctor.  John pissed in the bottle as did
his wife and teenage daughter.  Then while walking to his garage he had a
brainstorm.  John put a few drops of oil from his crankcase in the jar and
finally beat off and put a few drops of semen in the jar.  He drove to the
doctors office, shook the bottle, then handed it to the nurse.  This time his
urinalysis took half an hour.  Finally, John was ushered in to see the doctor.
   The doctor looked at him and said, "I've got some bad news, smartass.  Your
daughter is pregnant, your wife's got V. D., your car is about to throw a rod,
and if you don't stop beating off, that tennis elbow is never gonna heal!"

In the office of a Roman doctor: Specialist in women and other diseases.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In "Pissing in the Snow: Ozark Mountain Folktales", Vance Randolph tells of a
wizened old country doctor who could treat anything.  Well it seems one time,
one of the mountain folk came into his office with three complaints.  "Doc," he
said, "I can't taste nothin', I can't tell the truth, and I can't remember
nothin' besides."  Well the old Doc thought about this for a minute and went
back into the apothecary, and made of two capsules full with cow hooey, and gave
them both to the man, and telling him to take one immediately, chewing well.
Well, the man did as he was told, bit down and started chawing, then yelled out,
"Yeachhhh...  This stuff tastes like shee-it."  "Uh huh," the doctor said, "Well
I see that you can taste, and you're certainly telling the truth now.  And the
next time that you're memory is acting up, just take the other pill."  And the
old Doc charged the man fifteen bucks and sent him on his way, and never did
hear no trouble from him much after that.

There are several kinds of doctors, and it is told that they can be
differentiated by the following method:
General Practitioners know nothing and do little.
Surgeons know little and do everything.
Internists knows everything and do nothing.
Pathologists know everything and can do everything, but it's usually too late.

Everywhere this lady went, nobody wanted to talk to her, no one ever asked her
to go out.  Guys came up to her and turned away.  She wondered why this would
happen.  So she went to her doctor and told him what was going on.  She thought
that maybe there was a problem with her.  The doctor told her he would give her
a complete exam.  He told her to undress and get up on the table, so she did.
He told her to open her mouth and he checked it.  Then he asked her to get down
from the table and bend over.  He then said to the lady, "Know what your problem
is, you have zactly."  The lady then asked, "What is zactly?"  The doctor said,
"Lady your mouth smells zactly like your ass."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After much soul searching and having determined the husband was infertile, the
childless couple decided to try artificial insemination.  When the woman showed
up at the clinic, she was told to undress from the waist down, get on the table
and place her feet in the stirrups.  She was feeling rather awkward about the
entire procedure when the doctor came in.  Her anxiety was not diminished by the
sight of him pulling down his pants!  "Wait a minute!  What the hell is going on
here?" yelped the woman, pulling herself into a sitting position.  "Don't you
want to get pregnant?" asked the doctor.  "Well, yes, I do," answered the woman.
"Then lie back and spread 'em," replied the doctor.  "We're all out of the
bottled stuff.  You'll just have to settle for what's on tap."

This German guy wanted to marry this Polish lady, but Poland had a law that you
have to be Polish in order to marry someone that is Polish, so, in other words,
he'd have to have 50% of his brain removed.  So he goes to his doctor and says,
"I've just GOT to marry this woman, I love her so much..."  So the doctor says,
"Well, it's risky, but okay."  So into the operating room they go for the brain
removal procedure.  Later, when the German guy wakes up, the doctor comes in and
says, "We are VERRRRYYYY sorry, but we accidentally removed 75% of your brain
instead of 50%."  The guy looks up and says, "Mama Mia!"

   First man: There's a guy who lives up the street from me who used to work in
construction.  One day last year his hand got run over by a bulldozer.  Whatever
those doctors did, it's really amazing - today he's a concert pianist.
   Second man: That's nothing.  I knew a guy in college - laziest bum I ever
knew.  He was really fat and out of shape.  He was trying to hitch a ride one
day and got hit by a truck.  Broke nearly every damn bone in his body.  Somehow
they put him back together better than he was before.  Now he's a triathlete and
he's planning to try out for the olympics.
   Third man: Yeah, well I knew this poor retarded kid.  He couldn't do a whole
lot, but someone at the dynamite factory got charitable and gave him a job as a
stockboy.  Anyways, he's working in the warehouse one day and gets locked in. 
It's dark and he can't find the door.  Not being too bright, he lit a match to
try and find his way.  The whole place exploded.  All they could find of him was
a few fingers and his eyebrows.  From that little bit they were able to put him
back together and today that kid is the governor of Massachusetts.

A man goes to see his doctor.  He pokes himself in the arm, leg, and torso,
complaining that it hurts when he does this.  The doctor asked him if he was
Polish.  The man replied that he was.  To which the doctor replied that the
finger was broken.

This guy decides to get a sex change.  So he goes to the doctors and has the
thing done.  A couple of weeks later he was talking to one of his old buddies
about it.  "Gee, it must have really hurt when they shot all that silicon into
your chest to make your breasts."  "Not really, I hardly felt it."  "Well, it
must have really hurt when they chopped off your manhood!"  "Nope, I didn't
really feel it either.  The only thing that really hurt was when they drilled a
hole in my skull and sucked out half my brain."

   A woman goes to the hospital to visit a girlfriend who is about to have a
heart transplant.  She's worried about the friend so she asks the doctor...
   Girlfriend: I'm worried about my friend doc, what if her body rejects the
organ?
   Doctor: Well, she's 36 years old and healthy.  How long has she been in
business?
   Girlfriend: She's been working since she was 19 years old but what does that
have to do with anything?
   Doctor: Well, she's been working 17 years and hasn't rejected an organ yet!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This guy goes into a doctors and says "Doctor, doctor you've gotta help me.  I
just can't stop having sex!"  "Well how often do you have it?" the doctor asks.
"Well, twice a day I have sex with my wife, TWICE a day", he answers back.
"That's not so much", says the doctor.  "Yes, but thats not all.  Twice a day I
have sex with my secretary, TWICE a day," replies the man.  "Well that is
probably a bit excessive," says the doctor.  "Yes, but thats not all.  Twice a
day I have sex with a prostitute, TWICE a day," says the man.  "Well, that's
definitely to much", says the doctor. "You've got to learn to take yourself in
hand."  "I do", says the man. "Twice a day."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A new arrival, about to enter hospital, saw two white coated doctors searching
through the flower beds.  "Excuse me," he said, "have you lost something?"
"No," replied one of the doctors.  "We're doing a heart transplant for an
income-tax inspector and want to find a suitable stone."

What is the proper medical term for the CIRCUMCISION of a rabbit?
A Hare Cut.

There was a businessman, and he was feeling really crook, and he went to see the
Doctor about it.  The doctor says to him "Well, it must be your diet, what sort
of greens do you eat?" and the man replies "Well, actually, I only eat peas, I
hate all other green foods."  The doctor was quite shocked at this and says
"Well man, that's your problem, all those peas will be clogging up your system,
you'll have to give them up!!."  The guy says "But how long for, I mean I really
like peas!" and the doctor replies "Forever, I'm afraid."  The man is quite
shocked by this, but he gives it a go and sure enough, his condition improves,
so he realizes that he will never eat a pea again.  Anyway, one night, years
later, he's at a convention for his employer and getting quite sloshed and one
of the reps says "Well, ashully, I'd love a cigarette, coz I avint ad a smoke in
four years, I gave it up."  Quite a shocker really, and the barman goes,
"Really, I haven't had a game of golf in 3 years, because it cost me my first
marriage, so I gave it up!" and the businessman says "Thas nuvving, I haven't ad
a pea in 6 years" and the barman jumps up screaming "OK, everyone who can't
swim, grab a table...."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A CODE OF ETHICAL BEHAVIOR FOR PATIENTS

1.  DO NOT EXPECT YOUR DOCTOR TO SHARE YOUR DISCOMFORT.
Involvement with the patient's suffering might cause him to lose valuable
scientific objectivity.

2.  BE CHEERFUL AT ALL TIMES.
Your doctor leads a busy and trying life and requires all the gentleness and
reassurance he can get.

3.  TRY TO SUFFER FROM THE DISEASE FOR WHICH YOU ARE BEING TREATED.
Remember that your doctor has a professional reputation to uphold.

4.  DO NOT COMPLAIN IF THE TREATMENT FAILS TO BRING RELIEF.
You must believe that your doctor has achieved a deep insight into the true
nature of your illness, which transcends any mere permanent disability you may
have experienced.

5.  NEVER ASK YOUR DOCTOR TO EXPLAIN WHAT HE IS DOING OR WHY HE IS DOING IT.
It is presumptuous to assume that such profound matters could be explained in
terms that you would understand.

6.  SUBMIT TO NOVEL EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENT READILY.
Though the surgery may not benefit you directly, the resulting research paper
will surely be of widespread interest.

7.  PAY YOUR MEDICAL BILLS PROMPTLY AND WILLINGLY.
You should consider it a privilege to contribute, however modestly, to the
well-being of physicians and other humanitarians.

8.  DO NOT SUFFER FROM AILMENTS THAT YOU CANNOT AFFORD.
It is sheer arrogance to contract illnesses that are beyond your means.

9.  NEVER REVEAL ANY OF THE SHORTCOMINGS THAT HAVE COME TO LIGHT IN THE COURSE
    OF TREATMENT BY YOUR DOCTOR.
The patient-doctor relationship is a privileged one, and you have a sacred duty
to protect him from exposure.

10.  NEVER DIE WHILE IN YOUR DOCTOR'S PRESENCE OR UNDER HIS DIRECT CARE.
This will only cause him needless inconvenience and embarrassment.

   Johnny and Jim are walking through the desert.  Suddenly, a snake bites Jim's
prick!  "AAIIIIIII!!"  He panics, and John panics.  "What can we do?" "We should
call for a doctor." WHAMMM!  Suddenly, in the middle of the desert, there's a
telephone box.  Johnny goes in, calls a doctor.  RING, RING.  RING, RING.
   J: My friend is bitten by a snake.  What to do?
   D: What kind of snake?
   J: A one meter, green-yellow one.
   D: Aye, aye.
   J: ?
   D: Those are very dangerous.
   J: What can we do?
   D: The only thing you can do, is to suck the poison out.  Otherwise, your
friend will be dead within half an hour.
   Johnny hangs up, goes out off the telephone box.  Jim, pale looking already,
asks what the doctor said.
   Johnny: You'll be dead within half an hour.

   A young mother had just given birth to a newborn baby and the nurse was
congratulating her when the doctor came in bouncing the baby from hand to hand
like a basketball.
   "Here's your baby, maam" says the doctor.
   The doctor then throws the baby on the floor, hurls it up against the wall,
picks it up and twirls it around several times, and then drop kicks it straight
out of the 10th floor window.
   Totally bewildered, the woman gives out a loud shriek and hollers "My God!!!
What have you done to my baby?!?!!!"
   The doctor chuckles a little to himself and says "April Fools!!!  He was
already dead!"

   The crofter's wife went into labor in the middle of the night, and the doctor
was called out to assist in the delivery.  To keep the father-to-be busy, the
doctor handed him a lantern and said: "Here, you hold this high so I can see
what I'm doing."
   Soon, a lusty baby boy was brought into the world.
   "Och!" said the doctor. "Don't be in a rush to put the lantern by...I think
there's yet another wee bairn to come."
   Sure enough, within minutes he had delivered a bonnie lass.
   "Na, dinna be in a great hurry to be putting down that lantern, lad...It
seems there's yet another one besides!", cried the doctor.
   The crofter scratched his head in bewilderment, and asked the doctor: "Well,
now, mon.  Do ye suppose the light's attracting them?"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A blond guy visits the hospital.  "I want to be castrated!" he demands
cheerfully.  "Are you sure about this?" the doctor asks. "Have you discussed it
with your wife?"  "Yes, yes!  I've thought about this for a long time.  Let's
get it over with!"  So, the operation is performed.  Since it's relatively
simple, the blond guy only has to stay in the hospital for two days.  On his way
home, he meets a friend.  "Well, hello!  I haven't seen you for a couple of
days," his friend says.  "No, I've been to the hospital," replies the blond.
"Well, that's funny.  I'm on my way there right now!"  "Really?  So, what's up?"
"I'm going to be vaccinated."  "Oh, shit!!  That's what it's called!"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   How many doctors does it take to screw in a light bulb?
   That depends on whether it has health insurance.
   Three.  One to find a bulb specialist, one to find a bulb installation
specialist, and one to bill it all to Medicare.
   None.  They just tell it to take two aspirin and come round to the surgery
later.
   None.  They only sign the death certificate and phone the mortuary.
   None.  They would diagnose depression and prescribe benzo diazapines.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How many undertakers does it take to change a light bulb?
None.  They just paint them black and go on using them.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How is an undertaker like a bottle of Robitussin?
They both take away the coffin.

   A girl goes into the doctor's office for a checkup.  As she takes off her
blouse, he notices a red 'H' on her chest.
   "How did you get that mark on your chest?" asks the doctor.
   "Oh, my boyfriend went to Harvard and he's so proud of it that he never takes
off his Harvard sweatshirt, even when we make love," she replies.
   A couple of days later, another girl comes in for a checkup.  As she takes
off her blouse, he notices a blue 'Y' on her chest.
   "How did you get that mark on your chest?" asks the doctor.
   "Oh, my boyfriend went to Yale and he's so proud of it that he never takes
off his Yale sweatshirt, even when we make love," she replies.
   A couple of days later, another girl comes in for a checkup.  As she takes
off her blouse, he notices a green 'M' on her chest.
   "Do you have a boyfriend at Michigan?" asks the doctor.
   "No, but I have a girlfriend at Wisconsin.  Why do you ask?"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   This fellow had been suffering from excruciating headaches for some time, and
finally went to a doctor.  After a thorough exam, the physician called the
fellow into his office and said, "Well, I'm not exactly sure what is causing
your headaches, but we've found a cure for them: you'll have to be castrated."
   The man, needless to say, was taken aback, and told his doctor that he
believed he would try to bear the pain.  But as time went on, the headaches only
got worse, and finally, the poor fellow was driven back to the doctor.
   "All right, I guess I'll have the operation," he said.
   When it was all over, the man was understandably depressed, and his physician
told him, "I recommend you begin life anew.  Start over from this point."
   So the man decided to take the advice and went to a men's shop for a new set
of clothes.  The proprietor said, "Starting with the suit, looks like you take
about a 38-regular."
   "That's right", exclaimed the man, "How'd you know?"
   "Well, when you've been in the business as long as I have, you get pretty
good at sizing a man up", replied the salesman.  "Now, for a shirt, looks like
about a 15 long."
   "Right again," the man said.
   The proprietor suggested, "And for undershorts, I'd say a size 36."
   "There's your first mistake", the man said, "I've worn 34's for years."
   "No, you're a size 36 if I've ever seen one", said the owner.
   The man replied, "I ought to know what size undershorts I wear, and I'll take
34."
   The owner replied, "Well all right, if you insist, but they're going to pinch
your balls and give you headaches!!"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A really handsome man had a high squeaky voice.  He was surrounded by girls
except they ran off at the sound of his voice.  So he went to the doctor.  The
doctor said he could fix the problem by cutting off the man's penis.  The man
agreed to the surgery, and sure enough his voice went to normal and he was
surrounded by women.  Later he decided to get a whole new wardrobe.  The tailor
took a look at him and rattled of figures ending up with underwear size 36.  The
man said no I wear size 30.  The tailor said, "I've been doing this for years
trust me.  If you wore size thirty you voice would be high and squeaky."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A woman went to her doctor for a follow-up visit after the doctor had prescribed
testosterone (a male hormone) for her.  She was a little worried about some of
the side effects she was experiencing.  "Doctor, the hormones you've been giving
me have really helped, but I'm afraid that you're giving me too much.  I've
started growing hair in places that I've never grown hair before."  The doctor
reassured her.  "A little hair growth is a perfectly normal side effect of
testosterone.  Just where has this hair appeared?"  "On my balls."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A woman was going to marry one of those guys that want a virgin.  Since she was
not, she went to a doctor to reconstruct her hymen.  The doctor told her that
will cost around $500, but there is an another way that will cost only $50.  The
woman agreed to try the cheap way, paid the money, and the doctor worked on her
for several minutes.  After the "first night" the woman came back to the doctor
and told him that it was perfect.  The pain, the blood, everything was there.
And she asked him how he did it.  "I tied your pubic hair," he answered.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Patient: Doctor, you must help me.  I'm under such a lot of stress, I keep
losing my temper with people.
   Doctor:  Tell me about your problem.
   Patient: I JUST DID, DIDN'T I, YOU STUPID BASTARD!!!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Woman:  Doctor, my husband tells me my pussy's too big.  So I'd like you to
tell me if you find it unusual.
   Doctor: Please, take off your clothes and I'll have you examined.
   Doctor(shouting): What a giant pussy!!  What a giant pussy!!
   Woman(angry): Did you have to say it twice?!?
   Doctor: I didn't.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Three old ladies are sitting in a diner, chatting about various things.  One
lady says, "You know, I'm getting really forgetful.  This morning, I was
standing at the top of the stairs, and I couldn't remember whether I had just
come up or was about to go down."
   The second lady says, "You think that's bad?  The other day, I was sitting on
the edge of my bed, and I couldn't remember whether I was going to bed or had
just woken up!"
   The third lady smiles smugly.  "Well, my memory's just as good as it's always
been, knock on wood."  She raps the table.  With a startled look on her face,
she asks, "Who's there?"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A woman goes to the doctors, and says, "Doctor, I've got a bit of a problem.
I'll have to take my clothes off to show you."  The doctor tells her to go
behind the screen and disrobe.  She does so, and the doctor goes round to see
her when she is ready.  "Well, what is it?" he asks.  "It's a bit embarrassing,"
she replies, "These two green circles have appeared on the inside of my thighs."
The doctor examines her and finally admits he has no idea what the cause is.
Then he suddenly asks, "Have you been having an affair with a gypsy lately?"
The woman blushes and says, "Well, actually I have."  "That's the problem," the
doctor says, "Tell him his ear-rings aren't made of gold!!!"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This young couple had only been married for about two weeks when the wife
complains of a burning sensation in her chest.  She tells her husband who
suggests that she goes to the doctor to be examined.  She arranges an
appointment and goes the following day.  The husband, while at work receives a
call from the doctor.  Doctor: "I am sorry to say your wife has acute angina..."
Husband: "Yeah, I know, she's also got a nice pair of tits too!"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Seems a mute was walking down the street one day and chanced upon a friend of
his (also a mute).  In sign language, he inquired how his friend had been doing.
The friend replied (vocally!) "Oh, can that hand-waving shit.  I can talk now."
Intrigued, the mute pressed him for details.  Seems he had gone to a specialist,
who, seeing no physical damage, had put him on a treatment program that had
restored the use of his vocal chords.  Gesturing wildly, the mute asked if he
might meet this specialist.  They got an appointment that very afternoon.  After
an exam, the specialist proclaimed that there was no permanent damage, that the
mute was essentially in the same condition as his buddy, and that there was no
reason why he couldn't be helped as well.  "Yes, yes" signed the mute.  "Let's
have the first treatment right now!"  "Very well," replies the specialist.
"Kindly go into the next room, drop your pants and lean over the examining
table.  I'll be right in." The mute does as instructed, and the doctor sneaks in
with a broomstick, mallet and jar of Vaseline.  Greasing the broom handle, he
"sends it home" with a few deft swipes of the mallet.  The mute jumps from the
table, screaming "AAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaaa!!!"  "VERY good," smiles the doctor.  "Next
Tuesday, we start with 'B'"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A man went to a doctor.  Some say he went there to have an operation to become
Polish; others say he wanted to become an Aggie; there's yet another faction who
claims that he wanted to work at the post office; still others say he wanted to
make his hair permanently blond.  Regardless, the doctor asked him why, and he
said it was something he always wanted to do, how he wanted to be able to relate
to his friends, all of whom I suppose were blond Polish graduates of Texas A&M
who had found jobs at the local P. O.  Anyway, the doctor asked him his IQ, and
when he gave a three-digit reply, the doctor told him that the procedure would
have to involve the removal of over half of his brain.  The man insisted, and
since the doctor just happened to have a brand new laser device which could zap
just the right portions of brain tissue (a product of Scar Wars technology, I
suppose), the operation was planned.  The laser was hooked up to a computer
which could monitor the man's declining IQ on a nice LED display.  The doctor
threw the switch and the numbers began ticking off.  95, 94, 93...  Suddenly the
phone rang.  It was the doctor's wife.  They gabbed for minutes on end, the
doctor forgetting completely about his patient.  When he hung up, he suddenly
realized, and ran into the operating room, only to see the meter tick down: 6,
5, 4...  He ran to the machine and threw the on/off switch, just as the laser
was about to wipe out the last remnant of brain.  "Jesus, Matty and Felipe!"
exclaimed the doctor, "What have I done?  Speak to me!  Say anything!!"  The man
looked at him and said, "Hi, you're watching MTV, and we just heard..."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Man goes to doctor.  Says he's depressed.  Says life seems harsh and cruel.
Says he feels all alone in a threatening world where what lies ahead is vague
and uncertain.  Doctor says the treatment is simple.  The great clown Pagliacci
is in town tonight.  Go and see him.  That should pick you up.  The man bursts
into tears.  "But doctor...  I am Pagliacci."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Doc, I don't understand what's going on with me.  It's really strange,
sometimes I feel like a teepee."  The doctor thinks about it for a while and
then urges the man to continue.  So, the man continues, "And sometimes I feel
like a wigwam."  To which the doctor says "I wouldn't worry about it, Fred,
you're just two tents."  (Too tense, get it? :-) )

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   There once was a poor lad named Timmy who had the misfortune of being born
with only a head - no arms, no legs, nothing but a head.  Now Timmy was a
basically happy person and he was loved and cared for by his family.  As long as
he stayed within the shelter of his family he was unworried by his condition,
but as soon as he was thrust out into the world he knew that something was
seriously wrong.  He began to dream about being a whole person with arms and
legs and a body.  He thought of nothing else.  It became an obsession.
   Then one day, Timmy heard of the famous Dr. Helen Von Rigginbottom, a
physician who had been experimenting with cloning and tissue regeneration. 
Timmy grew so excited he could hardly contain himself.  He had himself rushed to
the doctor and made an appointment.  When the doctor met with Timmy all of his
hopes and dreams came true.  The doctor assured Timmy that she could help him
and would make him into a whole person, but she warned him that it could be a
dramatic change and he should consider all of the ramifications.  She began to
list some of the many problems he might have, but he would not listen.  She
consented and game Timmy the injection that would start the process.
   Timmy went home and tossed and turned on his pillow all night.  Eventually,
he fell asleep.  The next morning when he awoke Timmy was surprised to discover
that he was a whole person.  He had arms and legs and a body.  He was so excited
and grateful that he just had to thank the doctor, so he ran out of the house,
across the street and was hit by a truck and killed.  And of course the moral of
our story is: While you're a head, stay ahead.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   It had to happen sooner or later.  Lawyer Dobbins was wheeled into the
emergency room on a stretcher, rolling his head in agony.  Doctor Green came
over to see him.
  "Dobbins," he said, "What an honor.  The last time I saw you was in court when
you accused me of malpractice."
  "Doc.  Doc.  My side is on fire.  The pain is right here.  What could it be?"
  "How would I know?  You told the jury I wasn't fit to be a doctor."
  "I was only kidding, Doc.  When you represent a client you don't know what
you're saying.  Could I be passing a kidney stone?"
  "Your diagnosis is as good as mine."
  "What are you talking about?"
  "When you questioned me on the stand you indicated you knew everything there
was to know about the practice of medicine."
  "Doc, I'm climbing the wall.  Give me something."
  "Let's say I give you something for a kidney stone and it turns out to be a
gallstone.  Who is going to pay for my court costs?"
  "I'll sign a paper that I won't sue."
  "Can I read to you from the transcript of the trial?  Lawyer Dobbins: 'Why
were you so sure that my client had tennis elbow?'  Dr. Green: 'I've treated
hundreds of people with tennis elbow and I know it when I see it.'  Dobbins: 'It
never occurred to you my client could have an Excedrin headache?'  Green: 'No,
there were no signs of an Excedrin headache.'  Dobbins: 'You and your ilk make
me sick.' "
  "Why are you reading that to me?"
  "Because, Dobbins, since the trial I've lost confidence in making a diagnosis.
A lady cane in the other day limping..."
  "Please, Doc, I don't want to hear it now.  Give me some Demerol."
  "You said during the suit that I dispensed drugs like a drunken sailor.  I've
changed my ways, Dobbins.  I don't prescribe drugs anymore."
  "Then get me another doctor."
  "There are no other doctors on duty.  The reason I'm here is that after the
malpractice suit the sheriff seized everything in my office.  This is the only
place that I can practice."
  "If you give me something to relieve the pain I will personally appeal your
case to a higher court."
  "You know, Dobbins, I was sure that you were a prime candidate for a kidney
stone."
  "You can't tell a man is a candidate for a kidney stone just by looking at
him."
  "That's what you think, Dobbins.  You had so much acid in you when you
addressed the jury I knew some of it eventually had to crystallize into stones.
Remember on the third day day when you called me the 'Butcher of Operating Room
6'?  That afternoon I said to my wife, "That man is going to be in a lot of
pain.' "
  "Okay, Doc, you've had your ounce of flesh.  Can I now have my ounce of
Demerol?"
  "I better check you out first."
  "Don't check me out, just give the dope."
  "But in court the first question you asked me was if I had examined the
patient completely.  It would be negligent of me if I didn't do it now.  Do you
mind getting up on the scale?"
  "What for?"
  "To find out your height.  I have to be prepared in case I get sued and the
lawyer asks me if I knew how tall you were."
  "I'm not going to sue you."
  "You say that now.  But how can I be sure you won't file a writ after you pass
the kidney stone?"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Patient to eye-doctor: "I'm very worried about the outcome of this operation,
doctor.  What are the chances? "
  Eye-doctor to patient: "Don't worry, you won't be able to see the difference."

Tom had this problem of getting up late in the morning and was always late for
work.  His boss was mad at him and threatened to fire him if he didn't do
something about it.  So Tom went to his doctor who gave him a pill and told him
to take it before he went to bed.  Tom slept well and in fact beat the alarm in
the morning.  He had a leisurely breakfast and drove cheerfully to work.
"Boss", he said, "The pill actually worked!"  "That's all fine" said the boss,
"But where were you yesterday?"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A WASP was driving his car at Sonoma County, where is a large mental hospital,
he realizes that one of the tires of his car is flat.  He stops his car, looks
outside.  There is nobody around.  Also he realizes that the road he was riding
was near the mental hospital.  In short he realizes that there is no available
cheap labor to change the flat tire.  The WASP takes the spare tire out, jacks
up the car, removes the tire, puts the nuts in the hub cap and while trying to
get the spare tire, trips over the hub cap and all the nuts go down a nearby
storm sewer.  There he is, a WASP near a mental hospital, away from any cheap
labor, helpless.  Suddenly he hears someone yelling "Hey you!", looks and finds
that there is someone inside the mental hospitals' yard (behind the bars).  The
patient behind the bars says, "I have been watching you for a while and saw the
terrible thing happened to you, I think I can help."  "How?" asks the WASP.
"Easy," says the loonie, "Take one nut from each of the other three wheels and
put it on the fourth wheel, then if you are careful you will make it to the
nearest gas station."  "You are very smart" says the WASP to the loonie and
continues, "Why did they locked you in?"  "They put me in because I am a
loonie," the guy tells the WASP and continues, "Not because I am stupid."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Shortly after the 911 emergency number became available, an elderly and quite
ill lady appeared in a Rochester hospital emergency room, having driven herself
to the hospital and barely managing to stagger in from the parking lot.  The
horrified nurse said, "Why didn't you call the 911 number and get an ambulance?"
The lady said, "My phone doesn't have an eleven."  (This one is true!)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

An anxious woman goes to her doctor.  "Doctor," she asks nervously, "can you get
pregnant from anal intercourse?"  "Certainly," replies the doctor, "Where do you
think lawyers come from?"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lawyer: Did you say the plaintiff was shot in the woods?
Doctor: No, I said he was shot in the lumbar region.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This guy goes to his doctor to ask him a question.  The doctor says, "What can
I do for you?"  "Well doctor, I have a question for you.  I masturbate, and I
was wondering how often is too often."  "Hmmm," the doctor says, "how often do
you do it?"  "Three times a day." the man says.  "Yeah, that might be a little
excessive.  Have you considered finding yourself a girlfriend?"  "I have a
girlfriend, doctor", says the man.  "I mean a girlfriend for the bedroom as
well...", the doctor says.  The man says "Oh, she is, that's not the problem.
The problem is, she doesn't like to do it during mealtimes."

make love more than 30 times!"  The man walks home (deeply depressed); his wife
is already expecting him at the front door and asks him what the doctor said
concerning his problem.  He tells her what the doc told him.  She says: "Oh my

replies, "Yes, i already made a list on the way home; sorry your name is not on it!"

marriage to last, I say you at least take in a boarder."  The old man agreed.

always farting all of the time.  Although they don't smell, they do make loud
noises, and it is affecting my social life." The doctor gives him some pills,
and asks him to return next week.  He returns, and says, "Those pills did no
good.  In fact they made things worse.  I still fart as much, but now they smell
terrible." To which the doctor replies, "Good!  Now that we have your nose
working again, lets work on your farting"

and quietly said "Neither did I when I was a doctor."

Syadov walks into the Moscow health clinic and asks to see an ear-and-eye
doctor.  The nurse explains to him that there isn't a specialist in those two
areas at the clinic, but tells him that they have an eye-doctor AND an ear,
nose, and throat man.  She further goes on to suggest, after seeing his rather
vacant stare, that he see the ENT specialist, and, if that doesn't work, why
then he can go to the ophthalmologist.  So a month later (Remember, the clinic
is run by the Soviet bureaucracy) he is shown to the doc's office. The following
dialogue ensues.  Doctor: So, tell me, Comrade Syadov.  What seems to be the
trouble?  Syadov: DOC!  DOC!  Ya GOTTA help me!  I'm going crazy!  Doctor:  Just
calm down, and tell me your symptoms.  Syadov: Well, I..  OK.  I...  I'll try.
It's like my ears and my eyeballs aren't connected to the same man.  I can't see
what I hear, and I can't hear what I see!  At this, the doctor sighs, shakes his
head, closes his notebook, and prepares for his next patient.  When Syadov asks
what he's doing, he explains:  "Really, I'm very sorry, Comrade.  But there's no
known cure for Communism."

says the man, "what should we do?"  "Well," replies the doctor, "I'll give you a
thirty minute head start before I send her home.  And if she makes it, don't
fuck her!!!"

Once upon a time a sailor ran into his doctor's office and begged him for help.
He pulled down his pants and showed the doctor his dick, which was sporting a
ruby red ring around the tip.  He asked the doctor if there was any cure for
this strange VD that had appeared.  The doctor just smiled, soaked a cloth in
alcohol, and rubbed the end of the dick three times.  The sailor looked down and
saw that the ring was gone.  Ecstatic, he paid the doctor and ran off to catch
his ship.  A few months later, another sailor came to the doctor and said to
him: "A few months back, my buddy came here with a ring around his dick, and he
said you just rubbed it three times and he was cured.  Well, I have a similar
problem..." The sailor pulled down his pants and showed off his dick, which was
sporting an emerald green ring around the tip.  Well, the doctor just reached
into a pocket, took out a large knife, and with one whack cut off the sailor's
dick. "What did you do that for!?" screamed the sailor in agony. "Your buddy had
lipstick around his dick," explained the doctor, "You had gangrene."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   One day there was a guy who always scream when he talks.  Every time he tries
to talk to his family and friends the first thing they do is cover their ears
because the guy was about to scream.  So his family suggest him to go to the
doctor for a reason why he always scream.
   Doctor:  What is the problem, sir?
   Man: (screaming) I don't know?
   D: Why do you scream all the time?
   M: (screaming) I don't know?
   The doctor looks at his doctor book to try to find a cure for his ever
screaming voice.
   D: Well sir I think I know what the problem is.
   M: (scream) What is it?
   D: You must have a hugh penis.
   It turns out that the guy had a hugh 20 inch penis.  So the doctor suggest
that he remove 13 inches of his penis so that his voice will become normal.
After surgery, the guy wakes up and tried to talk.  "Um... hello... hello"   His
voice turned out to be normal as the doctor said that it would be.
   So four months later, the guy was curious what the doctor did with the rest
of the 13 inches that he cut out.  Maybe for research purposes or something he
thought.  He calls the doctor and asked him:
   Man: Sir you performed surgery on my penis a few months back.  Do you
remember?
   Doctor:  Hmm Hmm
   Man: Well I was just wondering.  What did you do with the rest of the 13
inches.
   Doctor: (screaming) I threw it away!!!!!

A man went to a doctor to have his penis enlarged.  Well, this particular
procedure involved splicing a baby elephant's trunk onto the man's penis.
Overjoyed, the man went out with his best girl to a very fancy restaurant.
After cocktails, the man's penis crept out of his pants, felt around the table,
grabbed a hard roll and quickly disappeared under the tablecloth.  The girl was
startled and exclaimed, "What was that?".  Suddenly the penis came back, took
another hard roll and just as quickly disappeared.  The girl was silent for a
moment, then finally said, "I don't believe I saw what I think I just saw...
Can you do that again?"  With a bit of an uncomfortable smile the man replied,
"Honey, I'd like to, but I don't think my ass can take another hard roll!"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Last year a guy went to a doctor because he was losing weight.  He found out he
had a tapeworm, and was instructed by the doctor to bring a muffin, a Twinkie
and a cookie with him on his next visit.  When he was being examined the doctor
shoved the muffin, the Twinkie, and finally the cookie up the guy's ass.  The
patient protested, but the doctor calmed him down, saying it was part of the
therapy.  This treatment continued for several weeks and every time the doctor
shoved a muffin, a Twinkie and a cookie up his ass.  Finally, after many visits,
the Doctor instructed the patient to bring a muffin, a Twinkie and a mallet for
the next visit.  The day arrived and this time the doctor shoved only the muffin
and the Twinkie up the patient's ass.  After a few minutes the tapeworm appeared
out of his asshole and demanded, "Where's my cookie!?"  WHAM!!!!!!!!!!!!

saw one", said the other.  They tossed it back and forth until one of them
suggested going over to talk to the man.  "Mr, this gentleman and I are both
doctors", said one, "and if you'll pardon our intrusion, I figured you have a

Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, in conjunction with research associate Dr. Ed
Bluestone of the Surgeon General's office, has compiled for non-confidential
distribution a list of activities which, while not definitely linked to death or
established as causative factors in any specific form of physical or
physiological deterioration, have been determined through exhaustive reiteration
to be detrimental to the human condition and specifically to the welfare of
their perpetrator.  While implementation of any of these activities is not
specifically illegal as cited by state or federal jurisdictions, engagement in
any of said activities could very probably be construed as a gross breach of
common etiquette constraints and/or moral codes and analogs.  Widespread or
accelerated participation in any of the listed activities by an increasing or
superannuated segment of the population would be frowned on by  and erosive to
all reasonable, respected, and stalwart facets of American society.

THE SURGEON GENERAL WARNS:

1.  Never raise your hand during a hijacking to indicate that you get a kosher
       meal.
2.  Never ask a bald man if you can borrow his toupee to clean your windshield.
3.  Never moon a werewolf.
5.  Never squeeze a parakeet to death while screaming, "I want the name of your
       accomplice!"
6.  Never threaten to punish your Dalmation with spot remover.
7.  Never use a bulldog as a surrogate mother.
8.  Never hire an attorney who can discuss specific episodes of The Flintstones.
15. Never trust an Oriental dentist who sells miniature ivory animals.
18. Never ask a dog with rabies if he would like you to floss his teeth.
19. Never believe your dog when he tells you that while you were out, your
       parents came over and drank water out of your toilet.
26. Never take a cockroach hostage and expect anyone to negotiate with you.
28. Never walk your dog around someone else's living room with a pooper scooper
       in your hand.
29. Never say to a lobster before you boil him, "Let me know if your bath is too
       hot."
31. Never tell an IRS auditor that if he doesn't leave you alone, you plan to
       cheat again next year.
35. Never tell Yasser Arafat that you think Newark should be the Palestinian
       homeland.

   Patient : Doctor, you've got to help me.  Every night I get the
uncontrollable urge to go downstairs and stick my dick into the biscuit tin.  Do
you know what's wrong with me?
   Doctor  : Yes...  You're fucking crackers.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   While we're on the subject of questionable doctors;
   A former professor of mine once mentioned that a physician friend of his used
to ask (in the old days) his female patients prior to physical examinations:
"Should I shave my beard first?"
   It toke me a while to get it.

   A woman starts dating a doctor.  Before too long, she becomes pregnant and
they don't know what to do.  About nine months later, just about the time she is
going to give birth, a priest goes into the hospital for a prostate gland
infection.
   The doctor says to the woman, "I know what we'll do.  After I've operated on
the priest, I'll give the baby to him and tell him it was a miracle."
   "Do you think it will work?" she asks the doctor.
   "It's worth a try," he says.  So the doctor delivers the baby and then
operates on the priest.  After the operation he goes in to the priest and says,
"Father, you're not going to believe this."
   "What?" says the priest.  "What happened?"
   "You gave birth to a child."
   "But that's impossible!"
   "I just did the operation," insists the doctor.  "It's a miracle!  Here's
your baby."
   About fifteen years go by, and the priest realizes that he must tell his son
the truth.  One day he sits the boy down and says, "Son, I have something to
tell you.  I'm not your father."
   The son says, "What do you mean, you're not my father?"
   The priest replies, "I'm your mother.  The archbishop is your father."

"Hospital costs prove 40% less in Canada
by Daniel Haney, AP Science writer

Washington -

Hospitals cost almost 40 per cent more in the United States than in Canada,
largely because [...]

[...]

U.S. hospitals are more expensive, in part, because the cases they treat are 14
percent more complex.  [Dr. Donald] Redelmeier, of Wellesley Hospital in
Toronto, writing in the New England Journal of Medicine] said this reflects
social differences between the two countries.  "Frostbite of the nose is not as
expensive to treat as a shotgun wound to the belly." he said.

"The Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America in its search for offending
pollens took samples of Los Angeles air.  Right outside its trendy Westside
office, this analysis showed that 40 percent of the collected contaminants
were from marijuana."

A man goes to the doctor for a checkup.  After the checkup, the doctor tells the
man he has bad news.  "You only have six months to live."  The man sits for a
while thinking, and then says, "There's only one thing I can do, I'm going to
become a Communist."  The doctor says, "You've been a patriotic American all
your life, why are you going to become a Communist now?"  The man says, "Better
one of them should die than one of us."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   A man speaks frantically into the phone, "My wife is pregnant, and her
contractions are only two minutes apart!"
   "Is this her first child?" the doctor queries.
   "No, you *idiot*!" the man shouts. "This is her *husband*!"

   Son: Father, Can I ask you a question?
   Father: Ok ask.
   Son: When a doctor doctors a doctor, does the doctor doing the doctoring
doctor as the doctor being doctored wants to be doctored or does the doctor
doing the doctoring doctor as he wants to doctor.
   Father : !!!??????!!!

   The patient went to his doctor for a checkup, and the doctor wrote out a
prescription for him in his usual illegible writing.  The patient put it in his
pocket, but he forgot to have it filled.  Every morning for two years, he showed
it to the conductor as a railroad pass.  Twice it got him into the movies, once
into the baseball park, and once into the symphony.  He got a raise at work by
showing it as a note from the boss.  One day he mislaid it.  His daughter picked
it up, played it on the piano and won a scholarship to a conservatory of music.

"The doctor said he would have me on my feet in two weeks."
"And did he?"
"Yes, I had to sell the car to pay the bill."

   A doctor and his wife were having a big argument at breakfast.  "You aren't
so good in bed either!" he shouted and stormed off to work.  By midmorning, he
decided he'd better make amends and phoned home.  After many rings, his wife
picked up the phone.
   "What took you so long to answer?"
   "I was in bed."
   "What were you doing in bed this late?"
   "Getting a second opinion."

A physician is not angry at the intemperance of a mad patient, nor does he take
it ill to be railed at by a man in a fever.  Just so should a wise man treat all
mankind, as a physician treats a patient, and look upon them only as sick and
extravagant.  - Seneca

A patient goes to a Polish doctor:
   Patient: I am having a hard time hearing.  I cannot even hear myself cough.
   Doctor: Here is a prescription, take the midicine for 7 days, then return for
a checkup.

SEVEN DAYS LATER:
   Patient: Thanks a million, doctor.  At least, I can hear myself cough NOW. So
what did you do to make me hear better?
   Doctor: Not much, I gave you medicine that increased your cough.

   A guy hasn't been feeling well for a while, so he goes to the doctor for a
check-up.  After he sees the doctor, the doc tells him he has a very serious
condition and would like to talk to his wife.  So the man leaves and sends his
wife in.  The doctor tells the wife that her husband has a very serious
condition and that he is going to die.  However, the doctor tells her that there
is one way she can save his life: She must cook him 3 meals a day and have sex
with him every night for 6 months and then he'll be OK.
   When the wife leaves the office her husband asks her what the doctor said. 
She looks at her husband and tells him, "He said you're gonna die."

   A doctor, a lawyer and a mathematician were discussing the relative merits of
having a wife or a mistress.
   The lawyer says: "For sure a mistress is better.  If you have a wife and want
a divorce, it causes all sorts of legal problems.
   The doctor says: "It's better to have a wife because the sense of security
lowers your stress and is good for your health.
   The mathematician says: "You're both wrong.  It's best to have both so that
when the wife thinks you're with the mistress and the mistress thinks you're
with your wife, you can do some mathematics.

   One night, as a couple lay down for bed, the husband gently taps his wife on
the shoulder and starts rubbing her arm.  The wife turns over and says "I'm
sorry honey, I've got a gynecologist appointment tomorrow and I want to stay
fresh."
   The husband, rejected, turns over and tries to sleep.  A few minutes later,
he rolls back over and taps his wife again.
   This time he whispers in her ear, "Do you have a dentist appointment tomorrow
too?."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Two gynecologists meet on a conference.  As usual, they tell each other what
cases they have had the past year.
1: Well, I have had a patient with breasts, just like melons.
2: Incredible, so big?
1: Yes
2: But I had a patient with a clitoris, just like a lemon.
1: Waaw, so big?
2: No, so sour

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

One woman says to another: "I can't understand why you haven't gone to see that
new gynecologist yet!  I mean he's so young and handsome!  And your gynecologist
is so old!"  The other woman replies with a smile: "Yeah, I know.  His hands
shake *all* the time!"

   A mature woman was in the pastorial study counseling for her upcoming fourth
wedding.
   "Father, how am I going to tell my husband that I am still a virgin?"
   "My child, you have been a married woman for many years.  Surely that cannot
be."
   "Well, father, my first husband was a psychologist, and all he wanted to do
was talk, and the next one was in construction and he always said he'd get to it
tomorrow.  The last one was a gynecologist and all he did was look.  But this
time, father, I'm marrying a lawyer and I'm sure I'm going to get screwed."


================================================================================

   A teenager of about 17 has a hot date with a girl, so he decided to go to the
pharmacy to buy some condoms.

(Conversation as follows)

   Pharm:  What can I help you with?
   Teen:  I'd like to...uh... ah... buy a condom.
   Pharm:  Ok.  Here you are.  (Sets condom, on counter.)
   Teen:  (Thinking that was rather easy and painless)  Well, now that I think
about it, I think I'll be needing two condoms.
   Pharm:  Well, okay.  (Gets another one).
   Teen:  (Getting bolder.)  Actually, its a pretty hot date I have tonight.  I
think I'll be needing four condoms.
   (Teen keeps changing his mind and increasing the number of condoms he wants
until he's leaving the pharmacy with 2 dozen condoms)
   Now the teenager arrives at his girlfriend's house.  She tells him that he's
invited to stay for dinner.  So he goes in and sits down at the table with all
of her family.  The father asks if he'd like to say grace before beginning the
meal.  He accepts and says the following:
   Teen:  Oh Lord, thank you for this food and the hands that made it, and the
people who took the time to grow it and...  (goes on for nearly 10 minutes,
blessing EVERYTHING including the table, the silverware, all the containers, the
floor, etc...) ...AMEN.
   Girl:  Gee, I didn't know that you were really religious.
   Teen:  Well, I didn't know that your dad was a pharmacist.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   This kid walks into the pharmacy: "I've a hot date tonight, a sure thing, and
my buddies said you could fix me up for it."
   "What do you want?"
   "Well, it's a hot date, man.  A sure thing?  You know..."
   "What do you want?"
   "I need some protection, alright??!?!"
   "What size?"
   "Size?  I dunno...  Whatever is considered average I guess."
   "That'll be $2.35 including tax."
   "Tacks?  Tacks?  I thought they stayed on by themselves!"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A guy walks into a local pharmacy and walks up to the counter where a lady
pharmacist is filling prescriptions.  When she finally gets around to helping
him he says, "I'd like 99 condoms please".  With a surprised look on her face
the pharmacist says, "99 Condoms!?!  Fuck me!" to which the guy replies, "Make
it 100".

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   A man walks into a pharmacy and asks for a pack of condoms.  As soon as he
has paid for them, he starts laughing and walks out.
   The next day, the same performance, with the man walking out laughing fit to
bust. The chemist thinks this odd and asks his assistant, that if the man
returns, to follow him.
   Sure enough, he comes into the store the next day, repeating his actions once
more. The assistant duly follows. Half an hour later, he returns.
   "So did you follow him?"
   "I did."
   "And...where did he go?"
   "Over to your house..."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A woman walks into the local pharmacy as ask to see sanitary napkins.
The pharmacist replys "We have mini-pads and maxi-pads, which do you prefer?"
The woman asks "What's the difference?"

Woman replys "My flo?  My flo is linoleum!"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   A young lad starts work in a pharmacy.  The owner is explaining the rudiments
of the job to the youth...
   "When a customer comes into the shop, be very polite to them and try to put a
little poetry into it when you're talking to them."
   The youth says that he does not see what the pharmacist means by this, so the
pharmacist says that he should observe when the next customer comes in and watch
how he or she is dealt with.
   Presently a middle aged woman comes in to the shop and asks for something for
a tummy bug.
   The pharmacist says " There's a lot of that virus going about, but this pink
mixture should sort you out!"
   "Oh thank you very much!" says the middle aged woman and she leaves the shop.
   So the pharmacist says the youth can serve the next customer while he goes to
tea break, "And remember to put some poetry into it" he says.
   Anyway, the youth waits around and nobody comes in, so he decides to go to
the restroom.  Just as he's about to nip off, a young teenage girl comes in.
   "Can I help you?" he asks.  She replies very embarrassedly that she would
like to buy some sanitary towels, to which the youth replies :
   "Hang on Miss, I'm dying for a piss, but I'll be back in a flash, with a sash
for your gash!"

   So Dracula's coffin was on a collision course for Jerry's pharmacy.
   Jerry was a quick thinker, so he whipped out a pack of cherry Halls and threw
it at the casket.
   The Halls really worked, 'cuz the coffin' stopped.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   A funeral procession was winding it's way to the cemetery on top of the hill
outside town, when the hearse hit a bump.  The coffin was bumped loose, fell out
onto the road and began sliding back toward town.  (It was a steep hill).  It
slid faster and faster; finally, it reached the town and was skidding its way
down Main St.  Suddenly, at one intersection, the coffin took a sharp right
turn, and entered a pharmacy, smashing through the big glass window at the front
of the store, it went down an aisle and banged into the counter at the back.
   The lid popped off, the corpse sat up and said, "You got anything to stop
this coffin?"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   A somewhat advanced society has figured how to package basic knowledge in
pill form.
   A student, needing some learning, goes to the pharmacy and asks what kind of
knowledge pills are available.  The pharmacist says "Here's a pill for English
literature."  The student takes the pill and swallows it and has new knowledge
about English literature!
   "What else do you have?" asks the student.
   "Well, I have pills for art history, biology, and world history," replies the
pharmacist.
   The student asks for these, and swallows them and has new knowledge about
those subjects.
   Then the student asks, "Do you have a pill for math?"
   The pharmacist says "Wait just a moment", goes back into the storeroom,
brings back a whopper of a pill, and plunks it on the counter.
   "I have to take that huge pill for math?" inquires the student.
   The pharmacist replied "Well, you know math always was a little hard to
swallow."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There was an old lady who heard you could keep cigarettes dry at the beach by
stuffing the pack into a condom.  She stopped into the pharmacy to pick some up.
The pharmacist said, "What brand of condoms to you prefer ma'am." She said, "I'm
not sure, they're for my Camels.", at which point he fainted.

   A psychiatrist on his rounds in a mental hospital sees a couple of patients
behaving rather strangely.  The first man is sitting on the edge of his bed
clutching an imaginary steering wheel and making loud train noises
"CHOOO-CHOOO...  WHOOOO-WHOOOOO..."
   "What are you doing?" enquires the doctor.
   "I'm taking a train down to Barcelona," replies the man.
   Somewhat taken aback but not to be put off, the doctor moves on to the next
bed where he can see some very energetic activity going on underneath the
covers.  On pulling them back he finds a man totally naked face down into the
mattress.
   "And what are you doing?" asks the doctor, a little perplexed.
   "Well," pants the man, "While he's in Barcelona, I'm fucking his wife."

A group of psychiatrists go to tour an insane asylum that is known for their
progressive rehabilitation methods.  They begin by visiting some of the
patients.  The first patient they visit is a young woman.  She is practicing
ballet.  One of the psychiatrist asks, "What are you doing?"  She replies, "I'm
studying ballet so when I get out of here I can possibly join a troupe and be a
productive member of society."  "Wow, that's wonderful."  The next person was a
man reading a book with a pile of books next to him.  The same question asked to
him, "What are you doing?"  "I'm studying biology, chemistry, etc.  So I can
enter medical school when I get out"  Room after room, they witnessed the
incredible success and attitudes of the patients.  Until they finally reached a
room the asylums director was reluctant to open.  Finally, he was persuaded to
open it.  Inside was a man balancing a peanut on his penis.  The reaction of the
psychiatrist, "My God what are you doing?"  The man replied: "I'm fucking nuts
and I'm never getting out of here"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   A man walked into a psychiatrist's office, sat down, took out a pack of

   The guy said, "Yeah Doc.  Got a match!?"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A man walks into the psychiatrists office with a pancake on his head, fried eggs

my brother."

plans."

   The man begins crying. "I'm sorry!  Its ruining my life.  I can't sleep.  I
do it every time I have a drink!  It's worrying me to death, please don't hit
me..."
   The bar tender takes pity.  "Look, I have a brother who is a psychiatrist,
here's his card, why don't you see him?"
   The man hugs the bartender, shakes his hand and leaves with a thousand thank
yous...
   Six months later, the man walks into the bar, and orders a drink.
   The bartender says "OK, here you go...  Wait!  Weren't you that guy who..."
   "Yes, And I went and saw your brother.  He is fantastic, I am completely
cured."
   "Well, that's great.  This beer is on the house"

on the bar.
   "You bastard!  I thought you said you were cured!"
   "I am!  It doesn't bother me anymore..."

The head doctors in an insane asylum had a meeting and decided that one of their
patients was potentially well.  So they decide to test him and take him to the
movies.  When they get to the movie theatre, there are signs of wet paint
pointing to the benches.  The doctors just sit down, but the patient puts a
newspaper down first and then sits down.  The doctors get all excited cause they
think maybe he's in touch with reality now.  So they ask him, "Why did you put
the newspaper down first?"  He answers, "So I'd be higher and have a better
view."

   An elderly couple went into a doctor.  They told the doctor "We're having
some trouble with our sex life.  Could you watch and offer some suggestions?"
   The doctor replied, "I'm not a sex therapist.  You should find someone else."
   The couple said, "No, No, we trust you."
   After watching them have sex, the doctor said, "You don't seem to be having
any troubles.  I wish my sex life was as good.  I can't give you any
suggestions."
   This was repeated the next week and also the third week.  After they had
finished on the third week, the doctor said, "You aren't having any trouble.  Is
this your idea of kinky sex?"
   The man replied, "No, actually the problem is that if we have sex at my
house, my wife will catch us.  If we have sex at her house, her husband will
catch us.  The motel charges us $50, and we can't afford that.  You only charge
$35, and Medicare pays half of that."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   A woman walks into her sex therapist's office and tells her that her husband
is not a very good lover, and they never have sex anymore, and asks what to do
about it.  The therapist tells her that she has an experimental drug that might
do the trick.  She tells the woman to give her husband one pill that night and
come back in the morning and tell her what happened.
   The next day, the woman comes in ecstatic telling the therapist that the pill
worked and she and her husband had the best sex ever.  She asks her therapist
what would happen if she gave her husband two pills and the therapist says she
doesn't know, but to go ahead and try it.
   The next day, the same thing happens, the woman comes in telling the
therapist that the sex was even better than the night before and what would
happen if she gave him five pills.  The therapist says she doesn't know, but to
go ahead and try it.
   The next day, the woman comes in limp but happy, and tells the therapist that
the sex just keeps getting better and what would happen if she gave her husband
the rest of the bottle.  The therapist says she doesn't know; it's an
experimental drug and she doesn't know what a full bottle could do to a person.
Anyway, the woman leaves the therapist's office and put the rest of the bottle
of pills in the husband's morning coffee.
   A week later, a boy walks into the therapist's office and says: "Are you the
dumb fuck who gave my mother a bottle of experimental pills?"
   "Why, yes, young man, I did.  Why?"
   "Well, mom's dead, my sister's pregnant, my ass hurts, and dad's sittin' in
the corner going "Here, kitty, kitty, kitty..."

years when he came home one day to confess to his wife that he had a terrible
compulsion.  He had an urge to stick his penis into the pickle slicer.  His wife
suggested that he should see a sex therapist to talk about it, but Bill
indicated that he'd be too embarrassed.  He vowed to overcome the compulsion on
his own.
   One day a few weeks later, Bill came home absolutely ashen.  His wife could
see at once that something was seriously wrong.
   "What's wrong, Bill?" she asked.
   "Do you remember that I told you how I had this tremendous urge to put my
penis into the pickle slicer?"
   "Oh, Bill, you didn't."
   "Yes, I did."
   "My God, Bill, what happened?"
   "I got fired."
   "No, Bill.  I mean, what happened with the pickle slicer?"
   "Oh...she got fired too."

best bone surgeon in town to do the operation.  The operation consisted of
lining up the broken hip and putting in a screw to secure it.  The operation
went fine, and the doctor sent the business man a fee for his services of $5000.
The businessman was outraged at the cost, and sent the doctor a letter demanding
an itemized list of the costs.  The doctor sent back a list with two things:

1 screw                   $   1
Knowing how to put it in  $4999
                          $5000 total

The businessman never argued.

"What kind of job do you do?" a lady passenger asked the man traveling in her
compartment.  "I'm a naval surgeon," he replied.  "Goodness!" said the lady,
"How you doctors specialize these days."

How many surgeons does it take to change a light bulb?
None.  They would wait for a suitable donor and do a filament transplant.

   A man goes into the hospital for a vasectomy.
   Shortly after he recovers from his an anesthetic, his surgeon comes in and
tells him: "Well, I've got good news and I've got bad news for you."
   "Give me the bad news first, Doc." says the patient.
   "I'm afraid that we accidentally cut your balls off during surgery, son."
   "Oh my god!" the patient cries, breaking into tears.
   "But the good news", the doctor adds, "is that we had them biopsied and
you'll be relieved to know that they weren't malignant!"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Three things nobody wants to hear the surgeon say:
- Oops.
- Has anyone seen my watch?
- That was some party last night.  I can't remember WHEN I've been that drunk.

At an international meeting, to surgeons were having an argument.  The Indian
surgeon was saying "No no no, I am telling you it is Woomba" and the African
surgeon is saying "No Man, it is Whoooooommmmmm"  They go on like this for about
10 minutes.  Up comes the English surgeon, and interrupts them. "Excuse me
chaps, but I do believe that the word you are trying to say is "Womb."  After he
has gone away, the African turns to the Indian and says "I bet you he has never
even seen a hippopotamus, never mind heard one fart under water.

Did you hear about the surgeon who used to be a collegiate quarterback that was
   bumped in the middle of doing a circumcision?
He slipped and got the sack!

   Doctors at King's College Hospital in London reported that Baby, a two year
old collie-Doberman, was apparently responsible for detecting a malignant tumor
on her owner's thigh.  She ignored moles and other marks on the body but spent
several minutes each day sniffing the tumor, attempting twice to bite it off. 
After several weeks, the owner finally sought medical advice.

   A recent study noted in The Journal of the American Medical Association
reported that, of two groups that entered a San Francisco hospital with equally
bad heart problems, the group that enjoyed prayer support from others had fewer
complications.

An young man, on his first visit to a big city decides to go visit the local
whorehouse.  A little while later he starts to feel sick.  He goes to see a
doctor of internal medicine.  The doctor examines him and says, "Well son, I
don't know how to tell you this, but you've got a bad case of syphilis,
gonorrhea, and about 12 other things I can't spell.  I'm afraid I'm going to
have to give you this medicine.  It'll make you get better but it'll also cause
your penis to shrivel up and disappear.  It's going to cost you $1000."  This
doesn't make our friend very happy so he goes and sees a surgeon.  The surgeon
examines him and says "Sorry, but it looks like a nice mix of syphilis,
gonorrhea, and a few other things to boot.  Afraid I'm going to have to cut your
dick off and charge you $2000."  By this time the guy is desperate so he goes to
see a doctor of holistic medicine.  The doctor examines him and comes to
essentially the same conclusion as the other doctors: an advanced case of V. D.
However, his approach to the problem is designed to save the patient unnecessary
expense, trauma, and worry: "Look, just go home and eat lots of good food, get
plenty of rest, and gets lots of sunshine and fresh air.  Wait about two weeks
and your dick will fall off all by itself."

It is recounted that at King's College in the Strand around the time of the war,
the Chief of Services would inevitably begin the year's rounds by teaching "a
singularly important principle of medicine."  He asked a nurse to fetch him a
sample of Urine.  He then talked at length about Diabetes mellitus.  "Diabetes,"
he said, "is a greek name; but the Romans noticed that the bees like the urine
of diabetics, so they added the word mellitus which means sweet as honey.  Well,
as you know, you may find sugar in the urine of a diabetic..."  By now the nurse
had returned with a sample of urine which the registrar promptly held up like a
trophy.  We stared at that straw colored fluid as if we had never seen such a
thing before.  The registrar then startled us.  He dipped a finger boldly into
the urine, then licked his finger with the tip of his tongue.  As if tasting
wine, he opened and closed his lips rapidly.  Could he perhaps detect a faint
taste of sugar?  The sample was passed on to us for an opinion.  We all dipped a
finger into the fluid, all of us foolishly licked that finger.  "Now," said the
Registrar grinning, "You have learned the first principle of diagnosis.  I mean
the power of observation."  We were baffled.  We stood near the sluice room
outside the ward, and in the distance, some anonymous patient was explosively
coughing. "You see," the registrar said continuing triumphantly, "I dipped my
MIDDLE finger into the urine, but licked my INDEX finger - not like all you
chaps.

An American, an Englishman and a Japanese fellow were discussing their
respective countries over drink at a London pub one evening.  The English fellow
mentioned how that British medicine had progressed so far that doctors recently
had taken a single liver and cut it into six pieces then transplanted it into
six separate men in need of a healthy liver.  This had resulted in six new
workers in the job market.  At this, the Japanese guy said that in his country
doctors had cut a lung into twelve pieces, transplanted these into twelve people
in need of healthy lungs, thereby putting twelve new people in the job market.
Not to be outdone, the American said "That's nothing.  In the U. S., we took
one asshole, made it President, and now there are 10 million people in the
market for a job!"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

At a party, an Israeli doctor says: "Medicine is so advanced in our country,
that we can take a kidney from one person, and put it into another, and have him
looking for work in six weeks." A German doctor says: "We can take the heart and
the lungs from a cadaver, and transplant them into a living person, and he'll be
looking for work in three months." An American social worker says: "We took a
quarter million assholes from the USSR, and transplanted them to Brighton Beach,
and not a single one is looking for work!"

   Three old men are sitting on the porch of a retirement home.  The first says,
"Fellas, I got real problems.  I'm seventy years old.  Every morning at seven
o'clock I get up and I try to urinate.  All day long I try to urinate.  They
give me all kinds of medicine but nothing helps."
   The second old man says, "You think you have problems.  I'm eighty years old.
Every morning at 8:00 I get up and try to move my bowels.  I try all day long.
They give me all kinds of stuff but nothing helps."
   Finally the third old man speaks up, "Fellas: I'm ninety years old.  Every
morning at 7:00 sharp I urinate.  Every morning at 8:00 I move my bowels.  Every
morning at 9:00 sharp I wake up."

A waiter in a Brighton Beach restaurant is so harried, he has no time to go to
the bathroom, so he pisses into a big vat of borscht.  Later he serves the
borscht to a client whom he recognizes as his doctor.  He asks: "Doctor, do you
think this borscht too sweet?  Can you taste sugar?" The doctor tries it and
says, "No."  "Thank you, doctor!  The medicine you prescribed me must have
helped."

The problem with the gene pool is that there is no lifeguard.

Did you here about the pharmaceutical company?  They developed a new drug that,
when administered to women, compels them to go join a convent.  The FDA refused
to license it, though.  Seems it was habit-forming.

The Joy Of Obesity
by Dr. John Cocker

   Obesity has been getting a lot of bad press recently.  Research conducted
entirely by thin people, has uncovered justification for their own masochistic
obsessive-compulsive, fun-killing anal retentative lifestyles.
   One of the great problems with research, of course, is that the researchers
tend to find what they're looking for.  And when they find it, they stop looking
for other things.  It's important, therefore, not to believe research by
pressure groups that start with preconceived ideas.
   Examples of findings not to believe: research on the benefits of exercise by
phys. Ed. Department, on the hazards of cholesterol by an anorexic and on the
joy of obesity by an overweight G. P.  The whole obesity phobia was started by
some statistics from a life insurance company purporting to show that people who
were overweight didn't live as long as people who were underweight.  These were
very raw figures and led to some unwarranted conclusions.
   First, it was assumed that if the overweight group lost weight they'd live
longer.  This was totally unproved.  It never will be proved, as there are just
not enough people to study who've lost weight permanently.  [95% of those who
lose weight gain it back again within 5 years -ed] [and the yo-yo effect of
losing then gaining many pounds repeatedly causes a greater health risk than
staying overweight. -ed]
   Second, it did not address the possibility that the obese group might have
another factor affecting lifespan.  It seems this is very likely, since the
Framington Study showed that if diabetics and those with heart disease were
removed from the obese group, the obese group lived longer.

Let's list some benefits of obesity:

   Overeating Is Fun.  Make a list of all the pleasures that are in this life
and you'll find the list isn't very long.  The one pleasure that's life-long and
never pales is eating.

   Carrying Fat Is Good Exercise.  If you believe in exercise (I don't), surely
carrying around 20 or 30 pounds of fat all day should be good for you.

   Obese People Are Nicer People.  This is not just a hasty remark, but the
result of careful clinical observation.  I've seen an average of 20 patients a
day for 30 years.  I can tell you that these people are more jolly, more kind,
more forgiving and just generally nicer.  Although it could be the other way
round, losing weight and keeping it off, is so rare that only
obsessive-compulsives are able to do it.  This may be admirable, but
obsessive-compulsives aren't relaxing people to be with.  [I agree.  Really thin
and athletic people are that way usually from a driving goal-oriented
personality.  In short, they are assholes. -ed.]

   Obese People Represent Superior Adaptation.  In days gone by, there were many
advantages to being able to convert excess food into fat.  The long winters were
better survived by those with a reserve of calories.

   Climatic Adaptation.  Obese people can survive cold better.  In particular,
their cold-water survival ability has been demonstrated many times.

   Obese People Make Better Lovers.  This is a fact known to romantics the world
over.  Bony lovers can never compete with what G.  K.  Chesterston referred to
as the "promise of pneumatic bliss."

   Anorexia, a terrible condition, is rare among obese people.

   Those who consider the highly trained athlete to be the ideal human might
want to consider the greatest duration runner of the animal kingdom, the
pronghorn antelope of Wyoming.  It can run 95km/h for an hour.  It has
tremendous lungs, an amazing cardiac output and a maximum oxygen uptake that
might deplete the Earth's resources.  So why didn't this marvel of nature become
a widespread species ?  Since these antelopes have no body fat, and can stand
neither cold nor lack or food, few survive the Wyoming winter.

Think about it.   []

of us died of tuberculosis.
