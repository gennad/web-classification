   An elderly couple went into a doctor.  They told the doctor "We're having
some trouble with our sex life.  Could you watch and offer some suggestions?"
   The doctor replied, "I'm not a sex therapist.  You should find someone else."
   The couple said, "No, No, we trust you."
   After watching them have sex, the doctor said, "You don't seem to be having
any troubles.  I wish my sex life was as good.  I can't give you any
suggestions."
   This was repeated the next week and also the third week.  After they had
finished on the third week, the doctor said, "You aren't having any trouble.  Is
this your idea of kinky sex?"
   The man replied, "No, actually the problem is that if we have sex at my
house, my wife will catch us.  If we have sex at her house, her husband will
catch us.  The motel charges us $50, and we can't afford that.  You only charge
$35, and Medicare pays half of that."
