A really handsome man had a high squeaky voice.  He was surrounded by girls
except they ran off at the sound of his voice.  So he went to the doctor.  The
doctor said he could fix the problem by cutting off the man's penis.  The man
agreed to the surgery, and sure enough his voice went to normal and he was
surrounded by women.  Later he decided to get a whole new wardrobe.  The tailor
took a look at him and rattled of figures ending up with underwear size 36.  The
man said no I wear size 30.  The tailor said, "I've been doing this for years
trust me.  If you wore size thirty you voice would be high and squeaky."
