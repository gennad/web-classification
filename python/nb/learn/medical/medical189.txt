A man who thinks he's George Washington has been seeing a psychiatrist.  He
finishes up one session by telling him, "Tomorrow, we'll cross the Delaware and
surprise them when they least expect it." As soon as he's gone, the psychiatrist
picks up the phone and says, "King George, this is Benedict Arnold.  I have the
plans."
