   The patient went to his doctor for a checkup, and the doctor wrote out a
prescription for him in his usual illegible writing.  The patient put it in his
pocket, but he forgot to have it filled.  Every morning for two years, he showed
it to the conductor as a railroad pass.  Twice it got him into the movies, once
into the baseball park, and once into the symphony.  He got a raise at work by
showing it as a note from the boss.  One day he mislaid it.  His daughter picked
it up, played it on the piano and won a scholarship to a conservatory of music.
