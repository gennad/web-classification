A woman is laying on a gurney out in the hall prior to going to surgery.  As she
lays there, a man in a white coat comes by, lifts up the sheet, and then leaves.
This happens a second time.  The third time this happens, she says "Doctor, am I
going into surgery soon?"  The man replies, "Don't ask me lady.  I'm just a
painter!"
