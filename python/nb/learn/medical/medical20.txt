   A man suffering from a severe case of flatulence goes to the doctor.
   Man: Doctor, I have a terrible (FARRRT!) problem.  I just can't (FFFART!!)
stop farting.
   Doctor: That is an unusual complaint.  Take off your clothes and lay, stomach
down, on the couch.
   The man does as he is told.  The doctor examines him for a minute - the man
farting all the time this is going on.
   Doctor: Aha!  This should be easy to cure.  Excuse me for a moment.
   The doctor goes over to a closet and pulls out a long pole with a sharp spike
at one end.
   Man: (FAART!) Oh my God!  (fart..)  What are you going to do with (FFFARTT!!)
that?!
   Doctor: I need to open a window.
