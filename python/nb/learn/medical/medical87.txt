A man went to see a doctor because of a very high, squeaky, annoying voice.  The
doctor examined him, and told him that the only way would be to replace his
extremely large penis with a smaller one.  The guy is desperate and decides to
go through with the operation.  It's a great success and the man has a fantastic
baritone.  But after some time the guy's sex life deteriorates and he decides to
see the doctor to try get his original equipment back.  He says to the doctor,
"Doctor, is there any way that you could get me my organ back, my sex life has
gone to pot."  "Not on your life!!" the doctor replies in a high, squeaky,
annoying voice.
