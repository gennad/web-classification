There was this city doctor who started a practice in the countryside.  He once
had to go to a farm to attend to a sick farmer who lived there.  After a few
housecalls he stopped coming to the farm.  The puzzled farmer finally phoned him
to ask whats the matter, didn't he like him or somethin'.  The doctor said, "No,
its your ducks at the entrance...  Every time I enter the farm, they insult me!"
