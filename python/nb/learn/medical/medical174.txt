   A mature woman was in the pastorial study counseling for her upcoming fourth
wedding.
   "Father, how am I going to tell my husband that I am still a virgin?"
   "My child, you have been a married woman for many years.  Surely that cannot
be."
   "Well, father, my first husband was a psychologist, and all he wanted to do
was talk, and the next one was in construction and he always said he'd get to it
tomorrow.  The last one was a gynecologist and all he did was look.  But this
time, father, I'm marrying a lawyer and I'm sure I'm going to get screwed."
