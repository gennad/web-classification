Once upon a time a sailor ran into his doctor's office and begged him for help.
He pulled down his pants and showed the doctor his dick, which was sporting a
ruby red ring around the tip.  He asked the doctor if there was any cure for
this strange VD that had appeared.  The doctor just smiled, soaked a cloth in
alcohol, and rubbed the end of the dick three times.  The sailor looked down and
saw that the ring was gone.  Ecstatic, he paid the doctor and ran off to catch
his ship.  A few months later, another sailor came to the doctor and said to
him: "A few months back, my buddy came here with a ring around his dick, and he
said you just rubbed it three times and he was cured.  Well, I have a similar
problem..." The sailor pulled down his pants and showed off his dick, which was
sporting an emerald green ring around the tip.  Well, the doctor just reached
into a pocket, took out a large knife, and with one whack cut off the sailor's
dick. "What did you do that for!?" screamed the sailor in agony. "Your buddy had
lipstick around his dick," explained the doctor, "You had gangrene."
