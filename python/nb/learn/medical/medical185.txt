   A psychiatrist on his rounds in a mental hospital sees a couple of patients
behaving rather strangely.  The first man is sitting on the edge of his bed
clutching an imaginary steering wheel and making loud train noises
"CHOOO-CHOOO...  WHOOOO-WHOOOOO..."
   "What are you doing?" enquires the doctor.
   "I'm taking a train down to Barcelona," replies the man.
   Somewhat taken aback but not to be put off, the doctor moves on to the next
bed where he can see some very energetic activity going on underneath the
covers.  On pulling them back he finds a man totally naked face down into the
mattress.
   "And what are you doing?" asks the doctor, a little perplexed.
   "Well," pants the man, "While he's in Barcelona, I'm fucking his wife."
