A man goes to the doctor and says, "Doc, I would like to live very long.  What
should I do?" "I think that is a wise decision," the doctor replies. "Let's see,
do you smoke?"  "Oh..  Half a pack a day." "Starting NOW, no more smoking."  The
man agrees.  The doctor then asks, "Do you drink?" "Oh, well Doc, not much, just
a bit of wine with my meals, and a beer or two every once in a while." "Starting
now, you drink only water.  No exceptions." The man is a bit upset, but also
agrees.  The doctor asks, "How do you eat?"  "Oh, well, you know, Doc, normal
stuff."  "Starting now you are going on a very strict diet: you are going to eat
only raw vegetables, with no dressing, and non-fat cottage cheese." The man is
now really worried.  "Doc, is all this really necessary?"  "Do you want to live
long?"  "Yes."  "Absolutely necessary.  And don't even think of breaking the
diet.  "The man is quite restless, but the doctor continues, "Do you have sex?"
"Yeah, once a week or so..., only with my wife!" he adds hurriedly.  "As soon as
you get out of here you are going to buy twin beds.  No more sex for you.
None." The man is appalled.  "Doc...  Are you sure I'm going to live longer this
way?" "I have no idea, but whatever you live, I assure you is going to seem like
an eternity!"
