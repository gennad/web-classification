A group of psychiatrists go to tour an insane asylum that is known for their
progressive rehabilitation methods.  They begin by visiting some of the
patients.  The first patient they visit is a young woman.  She is practicing
ballet.  One of the psychiatrist asks, "What are you doing?"  She replies, "I'm
studying ballet so when I get out of here I can possibly join a troupe and be a
productive member of society."  "Wow, that's wonderful."  The next person was a
man reading a book with a pile of books next to him.  The same question asked to
him, "What are you doing?"  "I'm studying biology, chemistry, etc.  So I can
enter medical school when I get out"  Room after room, they witnessed the
incredible success and attitudes of the patients.  Until they finally reached a
room the asylums director was reluctant to open.  Finally, he was persuaded to
open it.  Inside was a man balancing a peanut on his penis.  The reaction of the
psychiatrist, "My God what are you doing?"  The man replied: "I'm fucking nuts
and I'm never getting out of here"
