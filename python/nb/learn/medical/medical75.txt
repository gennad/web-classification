Man goes to doctor.  Says he's depressed.  Says life seems harsh and cruel.
Says he feels all alone in a threatening world where what lies ahead is vague
and uncertain.  Doctor says the treatment is simple.  The great clown Pagliacci
is in town tonight.  Go and see him.  That should pick you up.  The man bursts
into tears.  "But doctor...  I am Pagliacci."
