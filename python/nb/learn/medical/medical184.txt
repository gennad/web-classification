There was an old lady who heard you could keep cigarettes dry at the beach by
stuffing the pack into a condom.  She stopped into the pharmacy to pick some up.
The pharmacist said, "What brand of condoms to you prefer ma'am." She said, "I'm
not sure, they're for my Camels.", at which point he fainted.
