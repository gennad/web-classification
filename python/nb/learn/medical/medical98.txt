   One day, a guy comes into a doctor's office and says, "Doc, I want it to
grow."
   So the doc says, "Here, take three of these a day," and gives the guy a
bottle of pills.
   An hour later, another guy comes in and he wants it to grow too.  The doc
says, "Take 3 of these a day."
   "No, I'll take 6!" and the guy leaves.
   Then a cowboy comes in: He wants the same.  He's told to take 3 but says,
"Nah, I'll take 24!" and leaves.
   The next day all three guys come into the office.
   1st: "Doc, Doc, it's down to my ankles!"
   2nd: "Doc, Doc, it's draggin' an inch behind me!"
   Cowboy: "Yeeee-Haaah!"
