   Johnny and Jim are walking through the desert.  Suddenly, a snake bites Jim's
prick!  "AAIIIIIII!!"  He panics, and John panics.  "What can we do?" "We should
call for a doctor." WHAMMM!  Suddenly, in the middle of the desert, there's a
telephone box.  Johnny goes in, calls a doctor.  RING, RING.  RING, RING.
   J: My friend is bitten by a snake.  What to do?
   D: What kind of snake?
   J: A one meter, green-yellow one.
   D: Aye, aye.
   J: ?
   D: Those are very dangerous.
   J: What can we do?
   D: The only thing you can do, is to suck the poison out.  Otherwise, your
friend will be dead within half an hour.
   Johnny hangs up, goes out off the telephone box.  Jim, pale looking already,
asks what the doctor said.
   Johnny: You'll be dead within half an hour.
