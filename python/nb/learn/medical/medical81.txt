A WASP was driving his car at Sonoma County, where is a large mental hospital,
he realizes that one of the tires of his car is flat.  He stops his car, looks
outside.  There is nobody around.  Also he realizes that the road he was riding
was near the mental hospital.  In short he realizes that there is no available
cheap labor to change the flat tire.  The WASP takes the spare tire out, jacks
up the car, removes the tire, puts the nuts in the hub cap and while trying to
get the spare tire, trips over the hub cap and all the nuts go down a nearby
storm sewer.  There he is, a WASP near a mental hospital, away from any cheap
labor, helpless.  Suddenly he hears someone yelling "Hey you!", looks and finds
that there is someone inside the mental hospitals' yard (behind the bars).  The
patient behind the bars says, "I have been watching you for a while and saw the
terrible thing happened to you, I think I can help."  "How?" asks the WASP.
"Easy," says the loonie, "Take one nut from each of the other three wheels and
put it on the fourth wheel, then if you are careful you will make it to the
nearest gas station."  "You are very smart" says the WASP to the loonie and
continues, "Why did they locked you in?"  "They put me in because I am a
loonie," the guy tells the WASP and continues, "Not because I am stupid."
