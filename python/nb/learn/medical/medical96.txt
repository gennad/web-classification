This old man takes his wife to the doctor.  After the examination, the doctor
takes the man aside and says: "I've got some bad news for you.  Your wife either
has AIDS or Alzheimer's Disease, but I can't tell which."  "That's terrible,"
says the man, "what should we do?"  "Well," replies the doctor, "I'll give you a
thirty minute head start before I send her home.  And if she makes it, don't
fuck her!!!"
