   A funeral procession was winding it's way to the cemetery on top of the hill
outside town, when the hearse hit a bump.  The coffin was bumped loose, fell out
onto the road and began sliding back toward town.  (It was a steep hill).  It
slid faster and faster; finally, it reached the town and was skidding its way
down Main St.  Suddenly, at one intersection, the coffin took a sharp right
turn, and entered a pharmacy, smashing through the big glass window at the front
of the store, it went down an aisle and banged into the counter at the back.
   The lid popped off, the corpse sat up and said, "You got anything to stop
this coffin?"
