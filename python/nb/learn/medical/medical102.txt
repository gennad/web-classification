   One day there was a guy who always scream when he talks.  Every time he tries
to talk to his family and friends the first thing they do is cover their ears
because the guy was about to scream.  So his family suggest him to go to the
doctor for a reason why he always scream.
   Doctor:  What is the problem, sir?
   Man: (screaming) I don't know?
   D: Why do you scream all the time?
   M: (screaming) I don't know?
   The doctor looks at his doctor book to try to find a cure for his ever
screaming voice.
   D: Well sir I think I know what the problem is.
   M: (scream) What is it?
   D: You must have a hugh penis.
   It turns out that the guy had a hugh 20 inch penis.  So the doctor suggest
that he remove 13 inches of his penis so that his voice will become normal.
After surgery, the guy wakes up and tried to talk.  "Um... hello... hello"   His
voice turned out to be normal as the doctor said that it would be.
   So four months later, the guy was curious what the doctor did with the rest
of the 13 inches that he cut out.  Maybe for research purposes or something he
thought.  He calls the doctor and asked him:
   Man: Sir you performed surgery on my penis a few months back.  Do you
remember?
   Doctor:  Hmm Hmm
   Man: Well I was just wondering.  What did you do with the rest of the 13
inches.
   Doctor: (screaming) I threw it away!!!!!
