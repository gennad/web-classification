A woman was going to marry one of those guys that want a virgin.  Since she was
not, she went to a doctor to reconstruct her hymen.  The doctor told her that
will cost around $500, but there is an another way that will cost only $50.  The
woman agreed to try the cheap way, paid the money, and the doctor worked on her
for several minutes.  After the "first night" the woman came back to the doctor
and told him that it was perfect.  The pain, the blood, everything was there.
And she asked him how he did it.  "I tied your pubic hair," he answered.
