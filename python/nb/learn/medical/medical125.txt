A Soviet emigre comes to a doctor to show a red ring around the base of his
penis.  The doctor decides it's some unusual of venereal disease and prescribes
antibiotics, but they don't help, and one week later the ring is still there.
The doctor then sends a piece of penis skin covered with red to a lab for
analysis.  The lab reports: "The lipstick can be removed with soap and water."
