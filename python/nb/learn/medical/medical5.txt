   One day a man walked into the dentist"s office for some dental work.
   The dentist said "Sir, you have a tooth I must pull, What type of pain killer
would you like?"
   The man looked at the dentist and said "None, thanks, I have experienced the
second greatest pain in my life."
   The dentist said "Sir, pulling this tooth Will be painful, I suggest a
painkiller"
   The man looked back at the dentist and said "I have experienced the second
greatest pain in my life, Nothing else will ever compare."
   The dentist said "Sir, I"m telling you, use a painkiller."
   The man again said to the dentist "I have experienced the second greatest
pain in my life, I do not need painkillers, now pull the tooth."
   The dentist then said "OK, You asked for it, But first, tell me what was the
second greatest pain in your life?"
   The man said "Yes, I remember it well. I was hunting in some woods north of
here one snowy day. Walking through the woods, the urge came upon me and I
headed over to a tree. Well, I started to do my thing, and when the first part
dropped, It set off a large bear trap that was hidden in the snow that closed on
my balls. That was the second greatest pain in my life"
   The dentist then said "Ouch!, But then what was the first greatest pain in
your life?"
   The man replied, "When I reached the end of the chain."
