   One day, John's tennis elbow was acting up and he decided to stop in and see
a doctor.  When he got to the doctor's office the nurse told him he could see
the doctor in 15 minutes but, first he'd have to give a urine sample.  John said
that this was absurd but, the nurse insisted and John complied.  15 minutes
later, John was ushered in to see the doctor.
   "So that tennis elbow is really acting up, huh?" the doctor said.
   "The nurse must have told you," said John, wondering how the Doctor knew. 
   "No.  It was in your urinalysis." and the doctor continued to say that he had
just purchased this new machine that could diagnose every physical condition
with total accuracy based on the urine contents.  John didn't believe a word of
this but he did agree to provide another urine sample on check-up visit.
   Two days later, John was sitting at the kitchen table with his wife and his
teenage daughter.  He was telling them about this ridiculous machine.  When John
decided to have a little fun with the doctor.  John pissed in the bottle as did
his wife and teenage daughter.  Then while walking to his garage he had a
brainstorm.  John put a few drops of oil from his crankcase in the jar and
finally beat off and put a few drops of semen in the jar.  He drove to the
doctors office, shook the bottle, then handed it to the nurse.  This time his
urinalysis took half an hour.  Finally, John was ushered in to see the doctor.
   The doctor looked at him and said, "I've got some bad news, smartass.  Your
daughter is pregnant, your wife's got V. D., your car is about to throw a rod,
and if you don't stop beating off, that tennis elbow is never gonna heal!"
