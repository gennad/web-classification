An American has sex with a Soviet emigre woman and catches a strange venereal
disease (this time, a green ring around the base of the penis).  The patient
goes to a doctor who says he's never seen anything like it, but his penis would
probably have to be amputated.  The patient goes to another doctor, who also
doesn't know anything about this decease, but thinks the amputation is
indicated.  Deeply distressed, the patient decided to go to a Soviet emigre
doctor, figuring he may be familiar with this V. D.  Indeed, the Soviet emigre
doctor says: "I know this decease!  Your American doctors always want to cut.
Don't do anything.  Two week later, prick fall off by himself."
