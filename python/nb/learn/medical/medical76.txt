"Doc, I don't understand what's going on with me.  It's really strange,
sometimes I feel like a teepee."  The doctor thinks about it for a while and
then urges the man to continue.  So, the man continues, "And sometimes I feel
like a wigwam."  To which the doctor says "I wouldn't worry about it, Fred,
you're just two tents."  (Too tense, get it? :-) )
