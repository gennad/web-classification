   The crofter's wife went into labor in the middle of the night, and the doctor
was called out to assist in the delivery.  To keep the father-to-be busy, the
doctor handed him a lantern and said: "Here, you hold this high so I can see
what I'm doing."
   Soon, a lusty baby boy was brought into the world.
   "Och!" said the doctor. "Don't be in a rush to put the lantern by...I think
there's yet another wee bairn to come."
   Sure enough, within minutes he had delivered a bonnie lass.
   "Na, dinna be in a great hurry to be putting down that lantern, lad...It
seems there's yet another one besides!", cried the doctor.
   The crofter scratched his head in bewilderment, and asked the doctor: "Well,
now, mon.  Do ye suppose the light's attracting them?"
