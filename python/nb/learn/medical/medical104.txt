Last year a guy went to a doctor because he was losing weight.  He found out he
had a tapeworm, and was instructed by the doctor to bring a muffin, a Twinkie
and a cookie with him on his next visit.  When he was being examined the doctor
shoved the muffin, the Twinkie, and finally the cookie up the guy's ass.  The
patient protested, but the doctor calmed him down, saying it was part of the
therapy.  This treatment continued for several weeks and every time the doctor
shoved a muffin, a Twinkie and a cookie up his ass.  Finally, after many visits,
the Doctor instructed the patient to bring a muffin, a Twinkie and a mallet for
the next visit.  The day arrived and this time the doctor shoved only the muffin
and the Twinkie up the patient's ass.  After a few minutes the tapeworm appeared
out of his asshole and demanded, "Where's my cookie!?"  WHAM!!!!!!!!!!!!
