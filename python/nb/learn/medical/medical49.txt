This guy decides to get a sex change.  So he goes to the doctors and has the
thing done.  A couple of weeks later he was talking to one of his old buddies
about it.  "Gee, it must have really hurt when they shot all that silicon into
your chest to make your breasts."  "Not really, I hardly felt it."  "Well, it
must have really hurt when they chopped off your manhood!"  "Nope, I didn't
really feel it either.  The only thing that really hurt was when they drilled a
hole in my skull and sucked out half my brain."
