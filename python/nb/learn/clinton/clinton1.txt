     A little boy wanted $100.00 very badly and his mother told him to pray 
to God for it. He prayed and prayed but for two weeks nothing happened. Then 
he decided that perhaps he should write God a letter requesting the $100.00. 
      When the postal authorities received the letter addressed to God they 
opened it, read it, and decided to send it to the President. 
      The President was so touched and aroused that he instructed his 
secretary to send the little boy a check for $5.00. The President thought 
this would appear to be a lot of money for a  little boy. 
      The little boy was very delighted upon receiving the $5.00 and 
immediately sat down to write a thank you letter to God which went as 
follows: 
      "Dear God: thank you very much for sending me the money. I noticed that 
you had to send it through Washington. As usual, those bastards deducted 95 
percent."
