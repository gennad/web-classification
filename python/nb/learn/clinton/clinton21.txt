        The first requirement of all effective communication in a society is 
a common agreement on the definition of words and terms. 
        The easiest way to lie, mis-lead, or otherwise deceive those with 
whom one communicates is to use words, phrases, or terms that have different 
meanings to each of the parties.  Those individuals that are trying to 
resolve differences or convey concepts are BOTH the "deceived" and the 
"deceiver" when this happens.  ALL parties ( speakers or listeners; elected 
officials or voters) subject to the exchange of ideas suffer when there are 
no STANDARDS! 
              
        Examples: 
        "Taxes" = "Contributions" 
        "Spending" = "Investment" 
        "Millionaire = "..One who has X amount of Income" 
        "Teen-agers"  =  "..unemployed individuals who are under 30" 
        "Deficit" = "Debt" 
        "Spending Cuts" = "..Reduction in `planned' spending" 
        "Mandate" = "..one vote over a `simple majority' " 
        "Standards" = "..the most RECENT `consensus' of a `people' or group"
