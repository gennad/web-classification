Not to mention that Santa is a known abuser of little critters; do you know 
how the little angel got on top of the tree? It was Xmas eve & Santa was 
pulling his hair out; Donner & Blitzen were in heat & were kicking out their 
stalls, the elves had been organized by the AFL/CIO & were demanding higher 
wages, Ms Claus was bitching because Santa was spending another holiday on 
the road & the auto pilot in the sleigh was broke & the technician was 
demanding double time cause of the holiday. Suddenly the door of the workshop 
burst open & in came this little angel dragging this big tree; she shouted: 
"Santa! Santa! Where should I stick this tree?".
