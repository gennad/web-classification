Jim:  Hillary & Bill are on a bus trip (trying desparately to "market" their 
economic game play)....  At a truck stop in rural Georgia, they were fueling 
the bus when the attendant looked in and said:  "Hillary, remember me ? "   
Hillary made small talk with the attendant and told Bill they had da ted in 
High School.  Bill said: "See, honey, aren't you glad you married me.....you 
might be helping that attendant back there if you didn't".  
 To which Hillary replied:  "No Bill, if I had married him, HE would be 
president nowj".
