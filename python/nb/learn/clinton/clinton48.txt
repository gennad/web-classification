Just after returning from Japan, President Bill Clinton was furious to 
discover the White House was infested with mice (once again, Clinton pointed 
his finger at Regan and Bush) .  After working very diligently on the problem 
for several   minutesPresident Clinton realized he didn't have a clue as to 
how to get rid of the mice.-- So as usual, he turned to Hillary for advice.
