Did you hear about Hillary Clinton?  Last week she was visiting a hospital 
when she was led into a ward.  She entered one room and came upon a man 
masturbating.  She said "What is going on here?"  The doctor with her said 
"This man has a disease and this is all we can do to ease his symptoms."  
  Hillary was perplexed but accepted it and went into the next room.  In the 
next room she came upon a nurse performing oral sex on a man.  She said "Now 
what is going on here?"  The doctor with her said "This man has a disease and 
this is all we can do to ease his symptoms."  Hillary then asked "What is the 
difference between this man and the man in the last room?"  The doctor 
replied "This man here has health insurance!"
