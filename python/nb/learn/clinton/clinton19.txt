First Bother Roger Clinton, not being as bright, ambitious, or slick as 
Willie, was having a hard time picking up babes.  But one night he thought he 
was really scoring points with a hot blonde in a bar.  He figures it's about 
time to move things on to matters of a more penetrating nature and says "Hey 
honey, how about the two of us cruise over to your place?" she says "Sorry I  
can't.  I'm on my menstrual cycle" Roger says "That's OK.  I'll follow you on 
my Harley!"
