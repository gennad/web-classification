   This guy goes on vacation to a tropical island.  As soon as he gets off the
plane, he hears drums.  He thinks "Wow, this is cool."  He goes to the beach, he
hears the drums, he eats lunch, he hears drums, he goes to a luau, he hears
drums.  He TRIES to go to sleep, he hears drums.
   This goes on for several nights, and gets to the point where the guy can't
sleep at night because of the drums.  Finally, he goes down to the front desk.
   When he gets there, he asks the manager "Hey! What's with these drums.  Don't
they ever stop?  I can't get any sleep."
   The manager says, "No!  Drums must NEVER stop.  Very bad if drums stop."
   "Why?"
   "When drums stop...bass solo begins."
