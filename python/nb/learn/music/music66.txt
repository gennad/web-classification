The Golden Club, Las Vegas

The morning after a night on the town in Las Vegas, Bob told his friend about
the Golden Club that he had been drinking in.  Everything in the club was lined
with gold.  The glasses had a gold rim, the rail on the bar was plated with
gold, even the urinals were gold plated.  Bob was ready to believe his buddy
until he mentioned the gold plated urinals so he called the Golden Club.  "Is it
true that the glasses in your club have a gold rim?" Bob asked.  "Yes, it's
true" replied the voice on the other end.  "And is the rail on the bar plated
with gold?" asked Bob.  "Yes it is" was the reply from the other end.  "And, one
more thing, is it true that the urinals are gold plated?" inquired Bob.  Bob
could hear the person on the other end yell to the band "Hey Joe, I think I
found the guy that pissed in your saxophone last night".
