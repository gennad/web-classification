How to buy a stereo:

1)  Carefully calculate power requirements, based on room dimensions, etc.
    Multiply by a factor of 100.
2)  The ideal system should have as many lights as possible, preferably
    blinking and flashing in time with the music.
3)  The components should all have black metal finish, and generally look very
    C00L.
4)  The system should be broken up into as many components as possible.  (e.g.
    pre-amp, pre-pre-amp, post-amp, etc.)
5)  The most important part of a stereo system is the speakers, they should look
    very cool.  Size and number of sub-speakers is important.  (eg. woofers,
    tweeters, sub-woofers, super-sub-woofers, etc.)
6)  The system should resemble the cockpit of an F16 or 757 aircraft.
7)  The system should have full remote control capability, including over the
    mobile auto cellular phone so that the stereo can be playing as you get
    home.
8)  Should have the capability of playing different music in every room of the
    house.
9)  Components should have a cool names.
10) The complete set up should put a major recording studio or large radio
    station to shame.
11) Having state of the art equipment is not enough. You should be a year or
    two ahead of everyone else.  Equipment over the warranty period is obsolete
    and should be disposed of promptly.
12) The most important factor...
    Out of everyone you know who owns stereo equipment, yours should be better.
