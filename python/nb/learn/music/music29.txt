Bob is throwing a party.  Bob decides that to break the ice at his party, he'll
ask everyone what their IQ is, and then strike up an appropriate conversation
from there.  The day of Bob's party rolls around and when the first guest knocks
on the door, Bob asks the person what their IQ is.  "200,000" replies the first
guest.  "Well, that's great", says Bob, lets talk about ethereal astro physics.
Bob and this first guest talk about the aforementioned subject for a while.
Later in the party someone else is at the door.  Hi my name is Bob; welcome to
my party, what's your IQ?  The new guest responds with "250".  Great says Bob,
lets talk about advanced math.  Bob and his new guest talk about calculus and
statistics for a while.  Much later in the party after many more guests had been
arrived and spoken to by Bob, yet another guest arrives at the door.  "Hi, my
name's Bob; welcome to my party, what's your IQ?" This time the guest replies
after putting some thought into it: 5.  Well that's great, says Bob, what kind
of drumsticks do you use?
