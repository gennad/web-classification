How many drummers does it take to change a lightbulb?
Only one, but he'll break ten bulbs before figuring out that they can't just be
   pushed in.
   or
One, but only after asking "Why?"  ("Oh, wow! Is it like dark, man?")
   or
Two.  One to hold the bulb, and one to turn his throne (but only after they
   figure out that you have to turn the bulb).
   or
Twenty.  One to hold the bulb, and nineteen to drink until the room spins.
   or
None.  They have a machine that does that now.
