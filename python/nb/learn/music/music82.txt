At a concert hall one night the stage manager comes across an oboe player and a
viola player having a fight.  He breaks the fight up and asks what the fight was
about.  The oboe player says, "He broke my reed!  I was just about to play my
big solo when he broke my reed!"  "Well?" says the stage manager to the viola
player.  "What do you say to that?"  In umbrage, the viola player replies, "He
undid two of my strings but he won't tell me which ones!"
