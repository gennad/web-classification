manager greeted him and told him about the "progressive format."  "You see, we
have several different rooms here.  On the door of each you will see a number.
That number is the average IQ of the people inside."  The organist thinks this
is a wonderful idea, and soon finds Room 150.  Inside is a brass quintet
discussing brass quintet things, favorite composers, favorite instruments, and
the like.  The organist had just finished a concert with a brass quintet and was
in no mood for more.  He walked down the hall and found Room 100.  Inside was a
symphony orchestra holding a convention on who the greatest conductor of all
time is.  Since organists don't usually need conductors, he left.  Next was Room
60.  Inside was Philip Glass and John Cage.  The organist did not stay very long
at all (though Glass and Cage were inspired by the slamming door).  At the very
end of the hall was a battered old door with beer bottles, needles, and other
detritus.  But the organist was bored and decides that it's worth a shot.

room.  One punk says to the other: "So, what kind of sticks do you use?"

Last summer, the local orchestra decided to play Beethoven's 9th symphony.
However, it being quite hot, the players were working up quite a sweat, until a
neighbor let them use the ventilators in her house.  However, the wind from
these ventilators was causing the notes to blow all over the place, so they had
to tie them down to the note holders.  The din from the ventilators was so bad
that the bassists decided it didn't matter if they downed a few drinks and got
royally drunk.  Two of the bassists get so drunk, they pass out.  One of the
violinists, in disgust, decided to go home but slipped and fell.  Thus, it was
the bottom of the 9th, the bassists were loaded, the score was tied with two men
out and the fans were roaring wild when one of the players slid home.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It's Saturday night and the local orchestra is giving a concert, but it's five
minutes to curtain and the conductor still hasn't shown.  When the assistant
manager tells the manager about this, the manager goes berserk.  He asks all of
the employees if they can conduct, but none of them can.  He then goes to the
lobby and asks the patrons but doesn't find anyone.  He finally goes out on the
street and collars passerbys but still can't find anyone who can conduct.  In
desperation, the assistant manager points to a cat, dog, and horse that are
standing in the street.  The manager shrugs his shoulders and says "Why not,
what do we have to lose?"  He goes to the cat and asks if it can conduct and it
mews out "I don't know but I'll try."  The cat tries to stand on its hind legs
and wave its paws but it can't keep its balance and falls over immediately.  The
manager goes to the dog and asks the same thing.  The dog barks "I think I can,"
but although the dog can keep its balance for a while, it can't stand on its
hind legs long enough to last through an entire movement.  Finally, the manager
asks the horse if it can conduct.  The horse just stares at the manager for a
second, then turns around and presents its rear quarters and starts swishing its
tail in perfect 4/4 time.  The manager exclaims "That's perfect! The concert can
go on as scheduled."  "But, sir," protests the assistant, "will the orchestra
accept a horse as a conductor?"  Just then the horse drops a big pile of plop on
the street.  The manager looks at the plop and then at the horse's rear and says
"Trust me, from this angle, the orchestra won't even know that they have a new
conductor."

How to buy a stereo:

1)  Carefully calculate power requirements, based on room dimensions, etc.
    Multiply by a factor of 100.
2)  The ideal system should have as many lights as possible, preferably
    blinking and flashing in time with the music.
3)  The components should all have black metal finish, and generally look very
    C00L.
4)  The system should be broken up into as many components as possible.  (e.g.
    pre-amp, pre-pre-amp, post-amp, etc.)
5)  The most important part of a stereo system is the speakers, they should look
    very cool.  Size and number of sub-speakers is important.  (eg. woofers,
    tweeters, sub-woofers, super-sub-woofers, etc.)
6)  The system should resemble the cockpit of an F16 or 757 aircraft.
7)  The system should have full remote control capability, including over the
    mobile auto cellular phone so that the stereo can be playing as you get
    home.
8)  Should have the capability of playing different music in every room of the
    house.
9)  Components should have a cool names.
10) The complete set up should put a major recording studio or large radio
    station to shame.
11) Having state of the art equipment is not enough. You should be a year or
    two ahead of everyone else.  Equipment over the warranty period is obsolete
    and should be disposed of promptly.
12) The most important factor...
    Out of everyone you know who owns stereo equipment, yours should be better.
