A violist comes home late at night to discover fire trucks, police cars, and a
smoking crater where his house used to be.  The chief of police comes over to
him and tells him, "While you were out, the conductor came to your house, killed
your family, and burned it down."  The violist replied, "You're kidding!  The
conductor came to my house?"
