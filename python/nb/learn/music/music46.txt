An organist was out on the town and came across a new club.  He entered, and the
manager greeted him and told him about the "progressive format."  "You see, we
have several different rooms here.  On the door of each you will see a number.
That number is the average IQ of the people inside."  The organist thinks this
is a wonderful idea, and soon finds Room 150.  Inside is a brass quintet
discussing brass quintet things, favorite composers, favorite instruments, and
the like.  The organist had just finished a concert with a brass quintet and was
in no mood for more.  He walked down the hall and found Room 100.  Inside was a
symphony orchestra holding a convention on who the greatest conductor of all
time is.  Since organists don't usually need conductors, he left.  Next was Room
60.  Inside was Philip Glass and John Cage.  The organist did not stay very long
at all (though Glass and Cage were inspired by the slamming door).  At the very
end of the hall was a battered old door with beer bottles, needles, and other
detritus.  But the organist was bored and decides that it's worth a shot.
Inside are two punk-looking guys sitting on two stools in an otherwise empty
room.  One punk says to the other: "So, what kind of sticks do you use?"
